# Therapy- Part 1

## Overview {-}

Units 11 and 12 introduce the exciting, and ever expanding, world of therapy. Today, psychotherapeutic techniques are used to address a range of human conditions- from helping people find hope in overwhelmingly challenging circumstances to people exploring ways to optimize their potentials. Having a therapeutic relationship can be tremendously valuable in a person’s life as a therapist should be non-judgmental and have no other agenda than to help a person reach their therapeutic goals. The focus of this unit will be to provide some overview and perspectives on therapy.

### Topics {-}

This unit is will delve into the topic of :

- Therapies  

### Learning Outcomes {-}

By the end of this unit, student's will be able to:

- Define the key terminology associated with mental health treatment, psychological therapies, and biological treatments.  
- Describe the major barriers to seeking help for psychological disorders, arguments for and against involuntary treatment, and general approaches to conducting major types of psychotherapy.  
- Apply your knowledge to suggest what approach to therapy is likely most appropriate for a given situation, to identify major therapeutic techniques, and which drug therapies could be used for different psychological conditions.  
- Analyze whether self-help options, such as popular books, are a useful therapy option, the pros and cons of the major types of psychotherapy and whether St. John’s Wort, a popular herbal remedy for depression, works.

### Resources {-}

Here are the resources you will need to complete this unit:

- Krause, M., Corts, D., Smith, S. C., & Dolderman, D. (2018). *Revel for An Introduction to Psychological Science, 2nd Canadian Edition.* Pearson Ed.  
- Other resources will be provided online.  



## Therapies- Part 1

### Psychological Therapies {-}

Psychological therapies, or psychotherapies, are a general class of therapies that deal with the psychological (mental/behavioural) world of people with disorders.

These therapies are generally contrasted with biomedical approaches, which deal more with the biological world of the individual. Biomedical therapies focus on altering a person's biology to effect a change in the person's psychology.

### Eclectic Approach {-}

The eclectic approach is an approach that values the diversity of treatment approaches. Eclectic approaches deal with psychology and biology. In addition, various types of psychotherapies may be employed. Eclectic therapy approaches are becoming very popular.

### A Sin Problem? {-}

*“Many Christians are not satisfied with viewing psychological disorders as either illnesses or nothing but thought and behavior problems. They feel that both of these approaches are inadequate because they omit very important moral and spiritual questions. Consequently, the important issue of moral responsibility is not dealt with adequately.

They feel that since humanity's most basic problem is alienation from God as a result of sin, no other difficulty can be dealt with until the relationship with God has been restored. Thus the first goal of therapy is to bring the client to the place of acknowledging his or her need, and asking for divine forgiveness through Jesus Christ. Once the client has placed his or her trust in God, and is operating within the same religious conceptual framework as the therapist, therapy can then proceed to the identification of specific disturbances of thought and behavior. These are seen as examples of sin in that the individual is either acting in a sinful way towards others, or is harboring sinful thoughts and attitudes within. The therapist will assist the individual to identify, confess, and forsake these sins. The goal of therapy is seen primarily in terms of spiritual growth and a "closer walk with God."*

### Sin Only? {-}

In a work for Christian counselors, Koteskey (1983) gives the example of his eighteen month old son who developed an intense fear of dogs after two unpleasant experiences with them. Even the fact that the child was too young to talk did not prevent a fellow Christian psychologist from concluding that he had a spiritual problem. We should recognize that not every problem is necessarily a spiritual one. Just as a disturbance may have a purely biological cause, so too it may have a simple psychological (learning) explanation. Information gained from the study of animals may be helpful in the understanding of psychological problems as it is often vital in understanding biological problems. *(Both excerpts from Psychology and Christianity by Ronald Philipchalk)*

### Learning Activities {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

#### Read and Reflect {-}

For many people unfamiliar with the journey of counselling, finding suitable resources may feel daunting. It is important to know that there are many different approaches designed to help you accomplish the growth goals you have for your life. In this activity, the first resource, Psych Central is the oldest peer-reviewed psychology and mental health network on the Internet. Established in 1992, originally it was an index to mental health. Now it gives you the opportunity to see some treatment options for a wide variety of conditions. Additionally, there is a resource on different theoretical approaches to behavior change, and a link to some information concerning the integration of Christianity and psychotherapy.

- [**Integration Models**](http://www.psyche.gr/lpsycrel.htm){target="_blank”}  

#### Learning Lab Preparation {-}

Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week's Learning Lab:

- ***What is your view of the role of sin (or questionable moral behaviours) or other religious/spiritual beliefs in the treatment of psychological disorders?***  
- ***What kinds of religious/spiritual beliefs could lead to greater feelings of guilt/shame and increased psychological disorder?***  

***As we approach our final unit, please take a moment to look ahead to the "Term Paper" tab. Here you will find important information that ties to completing the course. It is important to begin preparing now, for these final assessments, in order to manage your time and avoid being overwhelmed. Not only will you have to complete your Quiz #3 at the end of Unit 12, but you will also be responsible for submitting a Term Paper and writing a Final Exam- it is strongly recommended that you begin planning now!***

```

## Assessment {-}

```{block2, type='assessment'}

While there is no "formal" assignment that you will be responsible for submitting for Unit 11, you will be expected to participate in discussion during your Learning Lab. Your facilitator will be providing a participation mark based on your contributions. Below is some information to consider prior to attending your Learning Lab:

#### Learning Lab {-}

Your facilitator will be providing a participation mark based on your contributions for this unit. Below is some information to consider prior to attending your Learning Lab:

*Active participation in group exercises, reflection, and critical discourse is an essential component of this course. You are expected to show respect for all members of the course, both in your speech and actions. Contribute by actively observing and listening, raising thoughtful questions, examining relevant issues, building on others’ ideas, analyzing and evaluating the group’s thinking, synthesizing key points, and expanding the group’s perspectives. Take care not to dominate a conversation, giving space for others to speak. When in small groups help maintain the focus, flow, and quality of conversations, and take the initiative to invite others (particularly those who are quiet) to speak.*

**Rubric for Participation in Learning Labs**

| Emerging (0-64%) | Developing (65-89%) | Mastering (90-100%)|
|-|-|-|
|Never to almost never: Demonstrates active listening (as indicated by disengaged body language and no to rare comments that build on others’ remarks),Initiates any contributions in class or small groups, Makes insightful or constructive comments, Helps maintain a supportive space for others to speak.|Sometimes to fairly often: Demonstrates active listening (as indicated by somewhat to often engaged body language and comments that build on others’ remarks), Initiates a contribution at least once in a class or small group discussion; Makes insightful or constructive comments, Helps maintain a supportive space for others to speak.|Very often to nearly always: Demonstrates active listening (as indicated by fully engaged body language and comments that build on others’ remarks), Initiates more than one contribution in a class or small group discussion, Makes insightful or constructive comments, Creates a space for others to speak and takes initiative to include others.|

```

## Checking your Learning {-}

```{block2, type='progress'}

Before you move on to the next unit, check that you are able to:

- Define the key terminology related to health psychology, stress and illness, and coping and well-being.  

- Describe how genetic and environmental factors influence obesity, how physiological reactions that occur under stress, and how the immune system is connected to stress responses.  

- Apply your knowledge of persuasion and health to examine the effectiveness of different types of cigarette warnings, and of the beneficial effects of optimism to help you reframe stressful situations as positive opportunities.  

- Analyze whether media depictions of smoking affect smoking in adolescents, the claim that ulcers are caused by stress, and whether activities such as relaxation techniques, meditation, and biofeedback actually help people cope with stress and problems.  

- Describe how control over the environment and positive and negative styles of coping influences well-being.
