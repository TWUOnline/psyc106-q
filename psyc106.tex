This is the course book for {[}insert{]}. This book is divided into 6 units of study to help you engage with the materials. The course resources and learning activities are designed not only to help prepare you for the course assessments, but also to give you opportinities to practice various skills.

Below you will find information about how to navigate this book. Please also refer the schedule in Moodle, as well as the Asseessment section in Moodle for instructions on required readings and assignments.

You should be reading this information in the context of a Trinity Western University course offered via Moodle. If this is not the case, then this may be an unauthorized reproduction of the course. Please contact \href{mailto:elearning@twu.ca}{\nolinkurl{elearning@twu.ca}} if you have concerns.

These notes will be your guide through the learning activities and assessment strategies necessary for you to succeed in the course, so it is important for you to engage to the best of your ability and take advantage of the resources available to you through Trinity Western University.

Assessment tasks are managed in other sections of the Moodle course, so be sure to familiarize yourself with those requirements and resources.

\hypertarget{how-this-course-is-built}{%
\section*{How this Course is Built}\label{how-this-course-is-built}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{How this Course is Built}

This course is primarily designed to be completed asynchronously, meaning that there are no scheduled times or places that you are required to meet, even online. You can work according to your own schedule \emph{within the six weeks you have to complete the course}. That said, this is a full university level course and there are timelines that we strongly recommend that you meet to ensure that you are succeeding in building your knowledge through the course.

It would be to your significant disadvantage to submit everything at the end of the course.

Asynchronous courses require learners to be well-organized and self-motivated, and we have included supports for you to help you develop strong learning habits that will ensure your success.

For example, there are several self-check quizzes throughout the course. These quizzes are not graded, but they can be powerful tools for you to ensure you understand key ideas and concepts. We suggest you take each quiz without the aid of your notes and textbook and multiple times until you have mastered the content. This strategy taps into three powerful learning structures that have been shown to be highly effective.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Effortful recall.} By intentionally trying to recall information without external aids, you are strengthening the neural pathways in your brain that lead to building new connections between ideas. One way to make recall easier is to connect key ideas to other things that you know or have experienced. For example, you might be studying World War II, and you connect the date that Canadians participated in the D-Day operation with something else meaningful to you that happened on June 6, like maybe the date you bought your first car.
\item
  \textbf{Spaced repetition.} By spreading out your attempts on the quiz (leaving a few days between attempts) you can maximize the effects of the first strategy (effortful recall) and ensure that your second or third attempts truly reflect what you know about the topic. We suggest leaving 1-3 days between attempt 1 and 2, then 4-5 days between attempt 2 and 3. You can use a tool like Trello, Notion, or Asana (free versions), or even a task list on your phone to set up a spaced repetition schedule.
\item
  \textbf{Interleaving.} This is the practice of studying a particular topic for a relatively short period of time (maybe 30-40 mins), then switching to a different topic for the same period, before going back to the original topic. We will help build this into your learning by including items from unit 1 in your unit 2-6 quizzes. You can also practice this by taking regular breaks in your work, or even by retaking a unit 1 quiz while you are working in unit 2.
\end{enumerate}

These three strategies are very effective at helping people \emph{remember} key facts about a particular topic, an important first step in learning at the university level. However, you will be asked to do much more than just remember facts. Your ultimate goal is to develop \textbf{evaluative judgement}, or the ability for you to judge for yourself the quality of your (or your peers') responses to prompts.

The discussion forums are a key way for you to do this. We have set up the forums in such a way that you will need to present a response to any given prompt before you see other learners' responses. We strongly encourage you to use this structure to formulate your own ideas before you present them in the forum, and then to use the responses of your peers to help you evaluate your own response.

Using these self-check activities in this way is designed to help you to succeed on the course assignments, upon which your final grade will be determined. These assignments will require you to \textbf{use} the facts of the course to generate unique responses to the prompts, based on your past experiences, knowledge, and ability to evaluate the quality of your own work.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Designer Babies}

It is beginning to look inevitable that, however fierce the debate, the technology to make designer babies will happen - maybe just 20 years from now. Geneticists claim to have found the gene for good-parenting, genes for obesity, Alzheimer's, red hair, and even happiness. Incredibly, scientists have even constructed an artificial human chromosome, which could carry any genes a geneticist - or prospective parents - desired.

Embryo A technique called Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) is already being used to screen embryos for genetic diseases. Embryos created outside the body using in vitro fertilization are tested to see whether they carry a genetic disorder before being transferred to the uterus. It's deeply controversial whether parents should ever be allowed to select embryos just because they're genetically different.

At the moment the technique is used for therapeutic purposes only, to screen for children who may have a deadly genetic disease. Even if some parents and their doctors were willing to use PGD for cosmetic or enhancement purposes, which remains absolutely taboo, the technique is limited in a crucial way - PGD can only select an embryo with genes inherited from the parents.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{A Child's View of God}

One evening on a camping trip several years ago, my wife and I listened outside the tent as our five-year-old Joelle and three-year-old Matthew tried to get to sleep. Always the ``mother,'' Joelle attempted to dispel her little brother's fear of bears and other wild creatures by reminding him that Jesus was watching over them. Not content with generalities, Matt responded, ``Does Jesus got a gun?'' \emph{(Psychology and Christianity by Ronald Philipchalk, p.~141)}

As any Sunday School teacher knows, children see God differently from adults---often in very concrete terms (protection requires a gun!). Studying cognitive development can help us to understand as well as teach children at their own level.

\hypertarget{the-process-of-cognitive-change}{%
\subsection*{The Process of Cognitive Change}\label{the-process-of-cognitive-change}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{The Process of Cognitive Change}

Our textbook provides a good summary of the structure (stages) of cognitive development. The section, however, does not address the process by which a person moves from one stage to the next. Piaget believed that the key to cognitive development is something called cognitive conflict or cognitive disequilibrium. For cognitive development to proceed, the individual must constantly re-evaluate his or her schemas. According to Piaget, we develop schemas from an early age of life. Schemas are our cognitive representations of the world. Schemas help us to organize our experiences. They also allow us to make predictions about what outcomes might result from particular behaviours. Schemas are very important in helping us to understand and to adapt to the world.

Although schemas are important in helping us to understand the world, they are not always accurate. People at all ages can have mental representations of the world that are not correct.

\textbf{\emph{Can you think of any examples of inaccurate schemas?}}

Although people at all ages can have inaccurate mental representations of the world, children are especially prone to view the world in an incorrect way. The reason children may view the world in an incorrect way is because the structure of their cognitive processing is developing. Piaget believed that inaccurate schemas are changed only when they are challenged in the cognitive structure of the child. This challenge has been termed cognitive conflict.

Basically, the process of cognitive change works as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  People are motivated to maintain a state of cognitive equilibrium.\\
\item
  When a child encounters information from the world and the information is inconsistent with his or her schema, the new piece of information creates a state of disequilibrium or cognitive conflict.\\
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Equilibrium}} may be restored through one of the two processes of adapation called assimilation and accommodation.\\
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Assimilation}} occurs when a child re-organizes the new information in such a way as to make the new piece of information consistent with his or her preexisting schema of the world.\\
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Accommodation}} occurs when a child alters his or her schema such that the new piece of information can now be incorporated into the new schema.
\end{itemize}

Thus the process of accommodation produces the greatest cognitive change. Can you think of examples of both assimilation and accommodation? Here is an example:

\textbf{Equilibrium-Preexisting Schema:} Child has grown up in an environment where all people he interacted with were of the same race (mom, dad, siblings, grandma, grandpa, etc.) Child has seen people of other racial groups, but has never interacted with them. Child develops the schema that people tend to like others who are of the same race as him or her.

\textbf{Cognitive Conflict Produced:} At four years of age the child begins to attend preschool. At this time he starts to interact with children of various races. The child begins to develop a friendship with a child of a different race. This friendship creates cognitive conflict for the child: ``How can I like someone who is a different color?'' To resolve this cognitive conflict, the child has two options:

\textbf{\emph{Option A}}- \textbf{Assimilation:} In order to maintain his or her preexisting schema, the child re-organizes the information such that the other child is not perceived to be so dissimilar after all: ``Maybe he is a different color from me, but we both speak English. We must not be so dissimilar after all.''

\textbf{\emph{Option B}}- \textbf{Accommodation:} The child's preexisting schema is altered such that the new information can be incorporated into a new way of perceiving the world, ``Maybe I can be friends with someone who is different from me.''

\hypertarget{cognitive-equilibrium-is-restored}{%
\subsection*{Cognitive Equilibrium is Restored}\label{cognitive-equilibrium-is-restored}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Cognitive Equilibrium is Restored}

Although cognitive equilibrium is restored via either assimilation or accommodation, assimilation serves to maintain an inaccurate schema (that differences inhibit the development of friendships) whereas accommodation serves to produce cognitive change and hence produces a more accurate representation of the world (that differences do not inhibit the development of friendships).

\section{Adolescence}\label{adolescence}}

John has just turned 13. Over the past year he has experienced may changes. He has grown over six inches and he has developed acne over his face and back. Not only is he changing physically, he is also experiencing a wave of emotional, spiritual, cognitive, and sexual changes. John has become self-focused and very self-critical. In addition, he is beginning to think abstractly and to challenge adults' ``dominion'' on knowledge. John is also on a quest to understand ``who he is'' and ``what his place is in the world''. John's quest for an identity makes him more vulnerable to peer pressure and to the influence of radical groups and cults. During this time that we call adolescence, John will make many decisions that will have a profound effect on the direction his life will take.

\emph{Does any of the above sound familiar?}

Before you begin reading the textbook section on adolescence, think back to your own adolescence. As you think about your experience of adolescence, use the following questions to guide your reflection:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What physical changes did you experience in adolescence?
\item
  How did these physical changes make you feel?
\item
  In what ways did your view of the world change during adolescence?
\item
  How did your way of treating other people change during adolescence?
\item
  What was most important to you during adolescence?
\item
  To what extent is ``who you are today'' a function of ``who you became during adolescence''?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{no-adolescence}{%

In other times and in other cultures to­day, adolescence does not exist as a significant and distinct period of develop­ment. This might seem surprising and difficult to imagine. Think of how modern society would be different, or if it could even exist, without a period of adolescence. What are the advantages and disadvantages of having an adolescent period?

\hypertarget{identity}{%

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Identity}

The concept of identity is a rich topic for consideration. The most familiar aspect of identity is occupational identity, since much of ``who we are'' in our society rests on the kind of work we do. Perhaps you can readily relate to this in your choice of major. Less familiar, but equally important, is ideological identity. Ideologi­cal identity, including both religious and political orientations, may un­dergo a tremen­dous upheaval during your student years. Do you have the same political beliefs as your parents? What about religious beliefs? Conflict and questioning of parental beliefs and values may be a necessary part of establishing your personal iden­tity---even if the beliefs and values you ultimately adopt are the same as those of your parents.

\hypertarget{psychosocial-development}{%
\subsection*{Psychosocial Development}\label{psychosocial-development}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Psychosocial Development}

There are many changes we experience during the time we call adulthood. According to Erikson's theory of psychosocial development, adults move through three important stages during which they must resolve important psychosocial conflicts:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Early Adulthood\\
\item
  Middle Adulthood\\
\item
  Late Adulthood
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\emph{In Early Adulthood}} (20-40 years of age) the psychosocial crisis is one of intimacy versus isolation. Although it is often perceived as critical whether or not the person develops an intimate relationship with a lifelong partner, Erikson believed that although this is one component of intimacy in this stage, other types of intimacy are also important---like developing intimate relationships with workmates, colleagues, and even one's children. If one fails to develop a sense of intimacy during this stage, he or she will feel isolation.

\textbf{\emph{In Middle Adulthood}} (40-65 years of age) the psychosocial crises is one of generativity versus stagnation. What is generativity? Erikson used the term gererativity to describe the process by which a person feels like he or she is making a lasting contribution in the world. Usually, generativity involves giving something back to the next generation. People at this stage can feel generative in many ways---coaching a softball team, being a scout leader, teaching children in Sunday School, been a big brother/sister, etc. If a person fails to develop a sense of generativity during this stage, he or she will feel a sense of stagnation.

\textbf{\emph{In Late Adulthood}} (65+ years of age) the psychosocial crisis is one of ego integrity versus despair. If the individual looks back on his or her life and feels a sense of pride in the accomplishments he or she has made, then the individual will feel a sense of ego integrity. However, if the person looks back on his or her life and does not see the significance of his or her accomplishments, then he or she will feel a sense of despair at the meaninglessness of his or her life.

\hypertarget{guilt}{%
\subsection*{Guilt}\label{guilt}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Guilt}

One of the most significant developments in childhood, from both a secular and Christian point of view, is a conscience with its attendant guilt. Is guilt simply a conditioned emotional response (as the behaviorist might say)? Is it the result of conflict with the superego (as a psychoanalyst would say)? Is it the failure to live up to our self-concept (as the humanist might say)? Is it the voice of the Holy Spirit? Or is it some combination of these? (For help on this issue and an important distinction between false and true guilt see Counts and Narramore (1970), Narramore (1984), Tournier (1962).) \emph{(from Psychology and Christianity, by Ronald Philipchalk, p.~146)}

The textbook discusses moral development in childhood and adolescence. However, many adults are troubled by questions of right and wrong, and in particular, by feelings of guilt. The Christian authors noted above suggest that many guilt feelings are not true guilt but false guilt carried over from childhood experiences. Understanding how conscience and guilt feelings develop can help to liberate us from unnecessary false guilt inappropriately attributed to God.

Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week's Learning Lab:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{\emph{What do you hope to accomplish during your ``adult development'' years?}}
\item
  \emph{(If you are past these years, what are you most pleased with?)}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{death-and-dying}{%
\section{Death and Dying}\label{death-and-dying}}

\hypertarget{death}{%
\subsection*{Death}\label{death}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Death}

Secular psychologists see death as final. Christians, however, see resurrection beyond, with death being but another step in that direction. What implications do these beliefs have for the process of dying?

As medical technology has advanced death has become more and more difficult to define. We need to focus our attention less on preserving the physical and more on preserving the personhood of the individual. This means giving greater attention to our concept of the dying person created in the image of God (as the abortion issue has forced us to do at the other end of life). When is personhood sacrificed to technical efficiency? Should we advocate a more ``natural death?'' What is ``natural death?'' How far does one go in ``allowing'' natural death? \emph{(from Psychology and Christianity, by Ronald Philipchalk, p.~146)}

\hypertarget{hospice}{%
\subsection*{Hospice}\label{hospice}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Hospice}

You matter because of who you are. You matter to the last moment of your life, and we will do all we can not only to help you die peacefully, but also to live until you die.'' \emph{(Dame Cicely Saunders)}

During the Crusades of the Middle Ages a hospice provided lodging for travelers: a place of refuge and comfort. So in 1967, when Dame Cicley Saunders opened a facility in London to provide care and comfort to dying people and their families, St.~Christopher's hospice was an appropriate name. \emph{(Courtesy of the Langley Hospice Society)}

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Cultural Variations}

The following issues are often subject to cul­tural variations:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Adolescence is unknown in some cultures
\item
  Adolescent struggles and conflict are much less in some cultures (e.g., )
\item
  Stage theories may not apply in other cultures
\item
  Ageism, especially with regard to intellectual abilities, is reduced, unknown, or even reversed in some cultures where the wisdom of old age is venerated
\item
  The ``social clock'' may be set differently in other cultures
\item
  Attitudes toward death vary greatly between cultures
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{assessment-2}{%
\section{Assessment}\label{assessment-2}}

In addition to your participation in this unit's Learning Lab, you will also be responsible for two formal assessments. The first, is your \textbf{Writing Assignment \#1} - more information can be found on this assignment by scrolling down the page. The second assessment that will take place is \textbf{Quiz \#1} - more information can be found by scrolling down the page.

\emph{Active participation in group exercises, reflection, and critical discourse is an essential component of this course. You are expected to show respect for all members of the course, both in your speech and actions. Contribute by actively observing and listening, raising thoughtful questions, examining relevant issues, building on others' ideas, analyzing and evaluating the group's thinking, synthesizing key points, and expanding the group's perspectives. Take care not to dominate a conversation, giving space for others to speak. When in small groups help maintain the focus, flow, and quality of conversations, and take the initiative to invite others (particularly those who are quiet) to speak.}

\hypertarget{writing-assignment-1}{%
\section{Writing Assignment \#1}\label{writing-assignment-1}}

Your first assignment for the course will involve reading a formal research article and extracting important information. Research articles play an important role in psychology as they present new findings and research that help us better understand the subject field. It is, however, important for us to understand what information is important as we weigh the value of the article we are reading. This assignment attempts to help us better understand those considerations.

Your first task is to read \href{assets/unit_4/Assessment_Empirical_Short.pdf}{\textbf{How to Read Empirical Articles}}

As you can see, it is important to understand \textbf{\emph{why}} you are reading an article and it is important to understand \textbf{\emph{what}} you want to get out of it.

Next, your task is to read \href{assets/unit_4/Assessment_Empirical_Long.pdf}{\textbf{How to Read a Journal Article in Social Psychology}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This article should help support your understanding of formal research articles and how to read them to support your research and learning.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{writing-assignment}{%
