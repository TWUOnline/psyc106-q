## Overview {-}

Welcome to LDRS 500 Leadership Foundations. In this course, we will analyze philosophical and theoretical approaches to leadership, including servant leadership, transformational leadership, and authentic leadership. We will dive into the scholarly literature about leadership, consider the thought leaders who influence leadership in our professional contexts, and consider how we can apply leadership concepts and values in our own sphere of influence as leaders.

Definitions of leadership since the early 1900s reflect evolving understandings of people, process, power and society. While the complexity of leadership is undeniable, our conceptualization of it in the Master of Arts in Leadership program aims to be holistic.

In our study of leadership, we will examine a wide range of scholarly writing. This scholarly inquiry into leadership will be accompanied by a review of case studies, and synthesis of this learning with our own experiences. Our studies will also provide an opportunity to consider exemplars from the social, economic, political and virtual public spheres. We also draw on the leadership example of Jesus as the ultimate example of a servant leader. Anyone who has had the experience of being a leader likely agrees with Brown (2019) who argues that, “Regardless of the complexity of the concepts, studying leadership is way easier than leading” (p. 4).

According to Brown, (2019) all leaders share the common experience of vulnerability – an experience that Brown (2018) argues is central not just to the experience of leadership, but also to life. Attending to this vulnerability is an important part of our growth as leaders, according to Brown (2019).

“Adaptability to change, hard conversations, feedback ,problem solving, ethical decision making, recognition, resilience, and all of the other skills that underpin daring leadership are born of vulnerability” (Brown, 2019, p. 43). What we need, Brown (2019) argues, are “braver leaders and more courageous cultures” (p. 6).

We will become scholars of leadership and engage in our own personal leadership development throughout the Master of Arts in Leadership. In this course, we will focus our reading, thinking, and writing on three leadership theories: servant leadership, transformational leadership, and authentic leadership. We will also study transformational servant leadership – a theoretical perspective that combines servant and transformational leadership theories.
