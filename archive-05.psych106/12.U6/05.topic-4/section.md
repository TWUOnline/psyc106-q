## **Compliance**


[plugin:content-inject](../_6-2)

---

This fictitious letter, based upon actual appeals I have received, contains several examples of techniques of persuasion. Without criticizing the writer's motives, a social psychologist could identify examples of card stacking, plain folks, foot-in-the-door, and other effective procedures of persuasion that we will discuss below.


Compliance refers to an intermediate level of influence. Here we have the familiar situation where a request is made of us, but it is assumed that we have a choice; we don't have to comply with the persuasive communication. In the letter we see the use of several techniques which have been found to increase the effectiveness of a persuasive communication:


  1. ***Card Stacking*** is the selection of only those examples which support the proponent's argument (Mr. Smith's example is presented as if it were typical).

  2. ***The Band Wagon Effect*** gives the impression that many other people are involved, and that everyone is doing it ("thousands of others are standing with you").

  3. ***A Testimonial*** is a personal example of the successful application of the proponent's argument (Mr. Smith provides a concrete example of what might be expected).

  4. ***Plain Folks*** refers to the association of the person or product with simple ordinary people ("this poor country boy").

  5. ***The foot-in-the-door technique*** is the attempt to get you to comply in a small way, knowing that this greatly increases your chance of complying to a larger request (in our example reading the letter, using the "prayer square," or sending a very small donation are small requests which could be followed up with requests for larger gifts).

  6. ***Name Calling*** is a technique which persuades people to reject something which they may know nothing about ("the forces of evil").

  7. ***Transfer*** is the association of a person or product with something that people already feel strongly about ("God," "family," "children").

These and other techniques have been shown to greatly increase the effectiveness of a persuasive communication. They are often quite apparent in appeals by religious leaders for financial support. Should Christians use these techniques of influence? *(from Psychology and Christianity by Ronald Philipchalk, p. 211, 213)*
