## Learning Activities

####:fa-book: **Learning Activity 6.4: Read and Reflect**

In this Topic we studied compliance and its use as a tool of influence. This will be the focus of this unit's Learning Lab. In order to prepare for discussion this week, take a moment to consider the following resources:

- [**Social Media and Its Stark Influence on Society **](https://scholarworks.bgsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&context=writ)
- [**Cults: Questions and Answers**](http://www.csj.org/studyindex/studycult/cultqa3.htm)

!!! *The purpose of the information being shared in this topic and through these resources is to help you recognize who and/or what you are allowing to be an influence in your life? Asking the question, “Who is teaching me how to be influential and what direction is that influence taking me in?” can be invaluable in helping you examine how you are spending your time and if you are truly satisfied in the direction of your life. Remember, tools of influence are just that – tools. Any tool can be used towards benefit or detriment, it just depends on how it is being applied.*

#### **Learning Lab Preparation**

Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week's Learning Lab:

- ***Have you ever been taught a sales technique in your job experience? If so, explain...***

If you have not been taught a sales technique, you certainly have experienced many as a consumer. Can you give an example? Here is one:

***One of the standard ways that door-to-door salespersons will try to get you to buy something is the so-called foot-in-the-door technique: They will ask you to do them a small favor. Having done so, you will have to justify your own behavior to yourself by think­ing nice things about the seller. Hence, you are more likely to comply when they ask you to sign on the dotted line.***
