## Learning Activities

####:fa-book: **Learning Activity 6.3: Read and Reflect**

This unit, we learned about obedience. We saw that obedience is strongest level of social influence. This will be the focus of this unit's Learning Lab. In order to prepare for discussion this week, take a moment to consider the following resources:

 - [**Conformity, Compliance, and Obedience**](https://www.units.miamioh.edu/psybersite/cults/cco.shtml)
 - [**Seven Things You Didn’t Know About Stanley Milgram**](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2008/12/26/seven-things-you-didnt-know-about-milgram/#.Xc8k9vZFyP9)
 - [**Stanley Milgram: His Life and Work**](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/~apkokot/MilgramBio.htm)
 - [**Canadian Code of Ethics for Psychologists**](https://cpa.ca/docs/File/Ethics/CPA_Code_2017_4thEd.pdf)
 - [**Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct**](https://www.apa.org/ethics/code/index)

!!! *As mentioned earlier, it is not necessary to read each resource thoroughly. What is important is to gain comprehension of the importance of using ethical guidelines when doing research on conformity, compliance, and obedience. Start to ponder how necessary is it to involve the use of deception in research. Ask yourself how you would feel if you were actually part of an experiment that was measuring compliance and you were deceived about what the researchers were actually doing? Also, while reading this information have you been able to recognize areas of your life where you are unquestionably following an authority figure? When answering questions like this I would encourage you to not be overly critical of yourself or others, rather, just notice where certain phenomena are present in your life and if you would like to do anything about it.*

#### **Learning Lab Preparation**

Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following scenario and questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week's Learning Lab:

*When people read about Stanley Milgram's experiments on obedience to au­thor­ity, they are often puzzled at the ethics of this research. You have probably have heard of these studies before and already have some views about the ap­propriate­ness of the procedures. All psychologists follow ethical guidelines in their research established by national governing bodies (e.g., CPA, APA). At the heart of these state­ments about ethics are the responsibilities to: protect the subject's welfare, avoid deception, provide anonymity, and provide therapy or relief from any unin­tended results of the experiment. Each of these general principles applies to the Milgram studies. Do you believe that the studies could be conducted today, given what we know now about ethics and about Milgram's results?*

- ***Does the severity of the problem studied—in this case destructive obedience—justify more extreme steps to manipulate and deceive experimental subjects?***
- ***Under what circumstances do you personally think that deceiving subjects in a scientific experiment might be ethically warranted or justified?***
