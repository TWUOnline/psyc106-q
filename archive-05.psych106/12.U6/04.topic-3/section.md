## **Obedience**

Obedience refers to the strongest level of social influence, the level at which an order is given and no choice is assumed. For example, we are expected to obey the law; we are not assumed to have a choice.

The study of obedience has proven somewhat unsettling for those with an optimistic view of human nature. Under orders, people have been willing to **(a)** subdue a helpless protesting individual with electric shock labeled extremely dangerous (Milgram, 1963); **(b)** administer a drug to a patient at double the recommended dosage, when the drug had not been approved by the hospital and when, contrary to regulations, the orders were given by an unfamiliar physician over the phone (Hofling et al., 1966), **(c)** place cute puppies in a restraining harness and give them strong electric shock (Sheridan and King, 1972). However, rather than uncovering a sadistic or evil type of individual these studies indicate that in the momentum of the situation, and under legitimate authority, people will perform acts which they would otherwise find abhorrent.

The ominous parallel with so-called "war crimes" is clear. Soldiers from many countries and in various wars have committed heinous acts of cruelty and slaughter against innocent men, women, and children. Yet they were not particularly evil or sadistic men; they were simply following orders. The research on obedience raises the chilling possibility that anyone of us would do the same thing in the same situation.

The potentially destructive power of religious authority was clearly demonstrated in 1978. In Jonestown, Guyana, more than 900 followers of religious-cult leader Jim Jones obeyed his orders and committed suicide by drinking poison. Christian leaders need to beware of the awesome power of their position, particularly when they claim to speak as the voice of God. *(from Psychology and Christianity by Ronald Philipchalk, p. 214-215)*

### Avoiding Destructive Obedience

How can you protect yourself from participating in destructive obedience? Actually, you may have already taken the first step. Growing evidence suggests that when people learn about research findings such as these, they tend to change their behavior to take this knowledge into account (Sherman, 1980). There are, however, several more active steps you can take to reduce your vulnerability to malevolent authority.

***First***, you can question the legitimacy of the authority. Ask yourself if the person giving the orders really has the right to command you to do what he or she is asking. Special uniforms, insignias, and titles can create an aura of authority even where none exists. For example, Brad Bushman found that 72 % of pedestrians gave change to a young man when ordered to by a woman in uniform, compared to 48 % when the woman was dressed in business clothes. Bushman found that the nature of the uniform did not even have to be related to the order being given (Bushman, 1984, 1988).

***Second***, ask yourself if your obedience might cause harm to someone else. Remember that even if you act under legitimate authority you are still responsible for any harm you produce.

***Third***, talk to others about your misgivings. This can not only strengthen your personal resolve, but it may also convince others to join you as well. In one field experiment, 21 out of 22 nurses were prepared to obey an unfamiliar physician whose order violated hospital policy and possibly endangered the patients. The nurses had no chance to consult with anyone else (Hofling et al., 1966). In a second study, however, when the nurses were given the opportunity to contact their supervisors and other nurses, only 2 out of 18 were willing to obey (Rank & Jacobson, 1977).

Milgram also demonstrated the effect of support for disobedience. In one experiment he employed two additional confederates. They posed as co-teachers who, along with the real subject, gave shocks to the "learner." One confederate refused to continue at 150 volts, the other confederate broke off at 210 volts. With this type of additional support, 90 % of the subjects refused to go all the way to the maximum shockâ€”total obedience was reduced to 10 % (Milgram, 1974).

***Finally***, if you decide to defy authority, you might take a lesson from the conformity research and remember the power of calm, reasonable dissent. One of the most famous literary examples of defiance, Herman Melville's Bartleby, the Scrivener, illustrates this "gentle rebellion:"

Bartleby manages to defy his employer and yet keep his job because his meek reply is so disarming. At times a more aggressive stance may be necessary, but remember, resistance is always possible. Obedience should not be blind. *(from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ronald Philipchalk)*
