### Learning Activities

####:fa-book: **Learning Activity 6.1: Read and Reflect**

Attributes, and our perception of attributes, has been the focus of this lesson. This will be the focus of this unit's Learning Lab. In order to prepare for discussion this week, take a moment to consider the following resources:

 - [**Attribution Theory**](http://healthyinfluence.com/wordpress/steves-primer-of-practical-persuasion-3-0/thinking/attribution/)
 - [**Cognitive Dissnonance**](https://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-dissonance.html)

These articles bring to light phenomena that tend to occur automatically (without conscious processing) for most people. Now that the concepts of attribution and cognitive dissonance are in your awareness it could be valuable to thoughtfully consider which attribution style you tend towards (dispositional or situational) and how that style influences how you treat others and how others respond to you. And, then ask, what am I doing with my cognitive dissonance? Do I tend to change my attitudes to fit my behaviours or do I adjust my behaviours to be alignment with my attitudes, values, and beliefs?

#### **Learning Lab Preparation**

Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following scenario. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week's Learning Lab:

- ***Describe a time when you were forced to act in a certain way, and then later found you had come to enjoy what you were doing. That is, your attitude followed your actions.***
- ***Could this happen with religious attitudes and beliefs too?***
