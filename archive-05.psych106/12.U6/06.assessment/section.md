## Assessment

While there is no "formal" assignment that you will be responsible for submitting for Unit 6, you will be expected to participate in discussion during your Learning Lab. Your facilitator will be providing a participation mark based on your contributions. Below is some information to consider prior to attending your Learning Lab:

#### **Learning Lab**

Your facilitator will be providing a participation mark based on your contributions for this unit. Below is some information to consider prior to attending your Learning Lab:

! *Active participation in group exercises, reflection, and critical discourse is an essential component of this course. You are expected to show respect for all members of the course, both in your speech and actions. Contribute by actively observing and listening, raising thoughtful questions, examining relevant issues, building on others’ ideas, analyzing and evaluating the group’s thinking, synthesizing key points, and expanding the group’s perspectives. Take care not to dominate a conversation, giving space for others to speak. When in small groups help maintain the focus, flow, and quality of conversations, and take the initiative to invite others (particularly those who are quiet) to speak.*

## Checking your Learning

Before you move on to the next unit, check that you are able to:

:fa-check: Define the key terminology associated with social influence, social cognition, and on attitudes, behaviour, and effective communication.

:fa-check: Describe why individuals conform to others’ behaviours, how individuals and groups can influence behaviours, and how we form first impressions and how these impressions influence us.

:fa-check: Apply your knowledge of the bystander effect to ensure that you will be helped if you are in an emergency, of social cognition to help overcome prejudice and discrimination, and of the central route to describe how a message should be designed.

:fa-check: Analyze whether guards who participate in abuse are inherently bad people, or if their behaviour is the product of social influences and whether people who commit discriminatory acts are necessarily prejudiced.

:fa-check: Describe how behaviours influence attitudes in terms of cognitive dissonance theory.
