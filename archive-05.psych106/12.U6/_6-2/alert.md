*My Dear Brother Jones,*

  *God has just laid your name upon my heart and I feel led to send you this “prayer square.” I am also enclosing the testimony of Mr. Smith whom God blessed with a $100,000/year job and two new Cadillacs after he used the “prayer square.” Follow the directions, and when you have finished send the “prayer square” back to me so that I can rush it to the next dear soul in need.*

  *Please place your gift on the “X” on the square when you send it back so that our family can continue to fight to keep this land safe for our children. Thousands of others are standing with you in support of this poor country boy fighting the forces of evil. Remember any gift however small will help.*
