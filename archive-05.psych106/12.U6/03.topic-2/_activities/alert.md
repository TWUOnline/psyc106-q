## Learning Activities

####:fa-book: **Learning Activity 6.2: Read and Reflect**

We investigated conformity, and the role it plays. This will be the focus of this unit's Learning Lab. In order to prepare for discussion this week, take a moment to consider the following resources:

 - [**Introduction to Social Influence**](http://www.workingpsychology.com/intro.html)
 - [**Conformity AND Obedience**](https://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/conformity.html)

!!! *Due to the pervasiveness of social influence, it cannot be overstated how important it is to understand the concepts and techniques associated with it. The purpose of these resources is to allow you to grow in your ability to be persuasive and to recognize when tools of influence are being used on you. It will also allow you to be more mindful of what/who you are conforming to and why it is that you are doing so. If you are really adventurous you may even want to take this knowledge to help you or someone else adopt a new attitude, belief, or action.*

#### **Learning Lab Preparation**

Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week's Learning Lab:

- ***What pressures for conformity exist in your community? On your campus?***
- ***What happens to people who do not conform?***
- ***Is conformity good or bad? What would society be like without conformity?***
