## **Evaluating Therapy**

## Therapy?

In a previous chapter, we looked at various ways of understanding personality. In the first part of this chapter we have been considering different therapies that grow out of these personality theories. Now it is time to ask the question, “Does it work? Is psychotherapy effective?” The answer seems to be “Yes,” but there are qualifications. First, many people who do not receive treatment get better anyway. And second, placebo treatments also produce improvements, as do non-professional caring relationships. As David Myers says,


! *“All types of psychotherapy seem to offer three benefits: new hope, a fresh perspective, and an empathic, trusting, caring relationship.” (p. 592)*

When you stop and think about it, isn't this what a good friend offers? Maybe if we all experienced (and offered) this kind of friendship, therapists wouldn’t be so much in demand.

## Therapy in Other Cultures

The process of psychotherapy generally assumes a cultural value of sharing your inner feelings and problems with another individual. David Ho observes that in the culture of Hong Kong, it is a sign of weakness to talk about one's problems and to reveal much of one's self. This cultural background influences the style of therapy and the process of psychotherapy. How would you proceed if you were a therapist?

Paul Pedersen (1985; 1987; 2000) suggests that we do not need to look at cultures outside North America to see differences in the process of psychotherapy. He sug­gests that different sub cultural minorities within North America approach psy­chotherapy with different values and different expectations. Native North American cultures, Asian immigrants, Hispanics, and Afro-Americans have different approaches to the pro­cess of psychotherapy. A therapist needs to be aware of these cultural differ­ences to perform effectively in the therapeutic situation.
