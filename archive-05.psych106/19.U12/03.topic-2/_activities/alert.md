It is important, when considering biological treatments, to receive input from more than one professional and to do adequate research on the treatment to understand the potential risks and benefits. This activity serves as a resource for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) as treatments for depression. It also has a link to explore an alternative therapy known as neurotherapy/neurofeedback, which is a safe (when administered by a well-trained professional), non-invasive option for a number of different developmental and psychological matters.

- ***As biological influence in psychological disorders becomes more obvious, what are the implications for psychologists and "talk therapy?‚Äù***
- ***Will biological therapies eventually replace old style talk therapies?***
