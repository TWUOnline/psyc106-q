## **Preventing Problems**

***A Little Help When You Need It...***

The textbook discusses the value of prevention on a broad level, including environmental changes. Here, we take a more personal look at how you might go about dealing with major problems or just simple blockages in your pathway to growth.

We all need help from time to time, whether we get it from family, friends, or paid professionals. Professional help can be a real boost. It might be testing to clarify career directions, sharing a relationship issue with a sympathetic listener, or in-depth study of a long-term problem. A trained helper provides an objective perspective and an empathic ear.

## An Ounce of Prevention

Being aware of the possible causes of psychological problems as well as the appropriate treatments can help you avoid similar difficulties in your own life. For example you can:

  - Not bury and deny strong emotions (psychodynamic view)
  - Take responsibility for your feelings & promote growth (humanistic view)
  - Associate positive consequences with desirable actions and negative results with undesirable ones (behavioral view)
  - Avoid negative self-talk in favor of positive (cognitive view)
  - Cultivate empathic, trusting, caring relationships
  - Take steps to ensure a healthy body
