## **Unit 12: Therapy - Part 2**

### Overview

As we arrive at our final unit, be sure to look ahead to the "Term Paper" tab to ensure you are organizing your workload in a manageable way.

Our final unit expands upon Unit 11 and introduces the exciting, and ever expanding, world of therapy. Today, psychotherapeutic techniques are used to address a range of human conditions, from helping people find hope in overwhelmingly challenging circumstances to people exploring ways to optimize their potentials. Having a therapeutic relationship can be tremendously valuable in a person’s life as a therapist should be non-judgmental and have no other agenda than to help a person reach their therapeutic goals. This final unit of the course will continue to build upon Unit 11 by discussing the effectiveness of therapy, some of the biological treatment options, and some tips on preventing problems.
