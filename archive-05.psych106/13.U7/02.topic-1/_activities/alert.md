## Learning  Activities

####:fa-book: **Learning Activity 7.1: Read and Reflect**

The following articles are intended to deepen your understanding of discrimination, racism, hate and violence. Hopefully this information will cause you to consider how youâ€™ve been informed about these topics. Additionally, it may be valuable, in light of the research, to consider how much hate and violence you have exposure to through gaming and TV and how this is impacting your attitude and behaviour towards other people.

#### **Learning Lab Preparation**

Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week's Learning Lab:

- ***If removing parts of the brain reliably reduced aggression, do you think violent criminals should be forced to have this operation?***
- ***Should violent content be removed from video games, movies, and TV (why or why not)?***
