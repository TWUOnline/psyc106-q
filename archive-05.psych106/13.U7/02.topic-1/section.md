## **Prejudice and Aggression**

### Prejudice & Religion

Some of the first research to study the effects of religion (Christianity) investigated its role in prejudice. The consistent finding of this line of study was that the more religious people were, the more prejudiced they were likely to be (Allport and Kramer (1946). Because racial prejudice is so clearly contrary to religious teaching, Gordon Allport called this Religion's Grand Paradox. In the area of racial prejudice in North America, Christianity did not appear to improve behavior.

Religion's Grand Paradox was gradually resolved as researchers refined their definition of religious. When the apparently prejudiced church attenders were divided into those for whom religion served a social function and was a means to an end (extrinsic religious orientation) and those for whom religion was an integral part of their lives and an end in itself (intrinsic religious orientation), it was the extrinsics who had raised the prejudice scores of the entire group. The intrinsics were found to be even less prejudiced than the non-attenders. Apparently an intrinsic religious orientation has a beneficial effect on behavior, at least on racial prejudice (Allport, 1959).

### Sports as Catharsis?

The idea that relieving emotional tension causes a purging of pent-up energy is called the catharsis hypothesis. According to Aristotle—who first proposed the concept of catharsis—even viewing powerful emotional events can be cathartic. Thus we should be able to reduce our aggressive tendencies by watching others act out their aggression, as well as by acting aggressively ourselves.

Research, however, does not lend much support to this common-sense idea. For example, Robert Arms and his associates report that hockey, football, and wrestling fans exhibit more aggression after viewing the event than before (Arms et al., 1979; Goldstein & Arms, 1971; Russell, 1983) (see Figure 11.1). Arthur Patterson (1974) found that high school football players were more aggressive after the season than before it. And Dane Archer and Rosemary Gartner report that a nation's murder rate tends to jump after a war is over (Archer & Gartner, 1976).

### Compensatory Machoism

Marshall Segall and his colleagues point out that cultures typically expect men to be macho —that is, to behave in ways that indicate their strength, virility, and willingness to confront an adversary. But Segall and his colleagues suggest that biological mechanisms interact with complex cultural processes to produce a kind of "compensatory machoism." Very briefly, the elements in this process are these:

  1. All societies have some division of labor by sex, resulting in sex-linked roles. For example, females do most of the child rearing in most societies and virtually all of it in some. Boys have less opportunity than girls to learn their roles by modeling because they are raised by women and have comparatively little contact with adult males.
  2. For various historical and environmental reasons, fathers in some societies are more likely to be absent. Paradoxically, in these societies young males are expected to develop a particularly distinct male identity. These young males are driven—consciously or unconsciously—to display "manly" behavior and avoid appearing "womanly" at all costs.
  3. Some societies recognize this need and provide initiation ceremonies that serve to "stamp in" masculinity for boys who need it because of inadequate opportunity to acquire it in childhood. These ceremonies affirm the young male's adult masculinity.
  4. Adolescent males in societies without initiation ceremonies may exaggerate their biological tendencies toward aggression in an attempt to assert their own masculinity.

Segall and his associates explain, "We suggest that in societies that have the preconditions requiring a stamping-in of masculinity, but which don't achieve this through initiation ceremonies or other institutionalized practices, adolescent males will try on their own to assert their masculinity" (p. 281). The Segall group calls the resultant aggression compensatory machoism. Compensatory machoism is the display of behavior intended to identify oneself with the cultural image of masculinity. The resulting aggression is rooted not in anger but in a "felt need to escape from womanliness and to mark one's masculine gender" (p. 281).

!!! ***Can you think of a cultural group in North America that seems to illustrate this process particularly well?***

Marshall Segall and his colleagues suggest that many young black American males illustrate this process. Social conditions (unemployment, educational deficits, racial discrimination) contribute to a prevalence of broken homes with female-headed households. Young men in these conditions attempt to assert their masculine identity through compensatory machoism. They are tough, independent, and violently aggressive. As a result, murder is their leading cause of death. A black man in stands a 1-in-21 chance of being murdered in his lifetime, compared with 1 in 131 for white men and 1 in 369 for white women. The Segall group quotes one young black male who says that in urban ghettos *"You must walk angry, talk angry, think angry . . . . You're either a chump or a champ . . . . You're macho or gay." (adapted from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ronald Philipchalk)*

### Empathy & Aggression

Several researchers suggest that empathy and concern for others may be important tools for reducing aggression. Prejudice, discrimination, and violent sexual aggression flourish when we dehumanize a victim. If a policeman is a “pig,” a homosexual a “fag,” or a woman a “playmate,” “pet,” or “bitch,” it is easier to excuse and even justify our hostile actions. Empathy reverses this process by making us identify with a potential victim. For example, Ken-Ichi Ohbuchi and his colleagues found that Japanese students gave less shock to a "victim" if the victim first aroused subjects' empathy by disclosing information about herself or by expressing her fear of shock. *(adapted from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ronald Philipchalk)*

### Conflict Resolution & Culture

Fumie Kumagai and Murray Straus report significant differences in the way con­flicts are resolved between marital partners in different cultures. Using the "Conflict Tactics Scale," these researchers asked high school seniors in, and the United States how their parents settled disputes. Violent means of "resolution" were most common in American couples, followed by Japanese, and then Indian couples.
