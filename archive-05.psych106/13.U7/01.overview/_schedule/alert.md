####:fa-book: **Learning Activity 7.1: Read and Reflect**

This activity is an opportunity to reflect on what you have been taught about racism and discrimination and attitudes of hate and violence. You will be able to ponder the ways in which your parent(s)/primary caregiver(s) addressed these topics as you were growing up in light of some current parental directions and encouragements regarding these topics. You’ll also be familiarized with some research considerations around the topic of video game violence and TV violence and their direct effects on anti-social attitudes and behaviours.

####:fa-book: **Learning Activity 7.2: Read and Reflect**

In this activity you can gain more insight into what is it that potentially makes you attractive to someone else and you attractive to others. One of the components influencing this is the structure of a person’s face. Much research has been done on this and the first article will outline some of the ways your face has shaped your social experiences. The second article adds to this discussion by looking at how willing people are to acknowledge the role of attractiveness in their own thought processes and decision-making. Next, the topic shifts to altruism. The first of these articles proposes that only reciprocal altruism exists. I would encourage you to read this article through the lens of, “Is it truly possible to know another’s motivation or intention?” Lastly, Random Acts of Kindness is a website that offers great resources and opportunities to increase kindness in your, and others, lives.
