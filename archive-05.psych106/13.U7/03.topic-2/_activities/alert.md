## Learning Activities

####:fa-book: **Learning Activity 7.2: Read and Reflect**

What is it that makes you think that someone is attractive, kind, evil, competent, upset, and the like? These resources will look at some of the factors that contribute to how you judge others and yourself. The first article outlines some of the ways your face has shaped your social experiences. The second article adds to this discussion by looking at how willing people are to acknowledge the role of attractiveness in their own thought processes and decision-making. Next, the topic shifts to altruism. The first of these articles proposes that only reciprocal altruism exists. Again, I would encourage you to read this article through the lens of, *“Is it truly possible to know another’s motivation or intention?”* Lastly, Random Acts of Kindness is a website that offers great resources and opportunities to increase kindness in your, and others, lives. I encourage you to participate in some of these activities to see how it makes you feel. Click on the links below:

#### **Learning Lab Preparation**

Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week's Learning Lab:

- ***What do you think contribute to you being able to quickly judge whether or not you think someone is attractive?***
- ***Some social psychologists believe that there is always a reward for helping and that this motivates people to help. In other words, people never help without expecting a reward of some kind (either in this life or in the next). What do you think?***
