## **Attraction & Altruism**

*Why do I like you? Let me count the ways:*

- We often like people for whom we have suffered.
- We like people more after we have done small favours for them.
- We like people best whose (accidentally over­heard) descriptions of us begin on a negative note and end with a posi­tive tone.
- We like people who convert to our point of view better than we like people who have agreed with us all along.
- We like highly competent people better after they have committed a blunder.

### Culture & Attraction

The characteristics that are attractive in the opposite sex, as well as the impor­tance of physical attractiveness, are different in different cultures. Deborah Stiles and her colleagues found that Mexican adolescents valued liking children, helping others, high intelligence, and inner goodness and honesty in their oppo­site-sex ideal. American adolescents gave higher ratings to having a lot of money, being fun, popular, good looking, and sexy. Karen Dion and her colleagues found that physical attractiveness is more impor­tant in a culture where individualism (Canadian) rather than collectivism (Chinese) is valued.

David Buss and 49 collaborators in 33 countries asked young men and women (average age 23 years) about the attributes they looked for in potential mates. The researchers found many differences among cultures. The most pervasive difference they found was the emphasis given to "traditional" versus "modern" attributes. Young people looking for a mate in, and place great value on the traditional attributes of chastity, home and children, domestic skills, and providing for the family. At the other extreme, in the , , , and , young people looking for mates did not consider these attributes very important.

!!! ***(Canadian and American values were in between these extremes).***

American young people differed from the international average by placing a higher value on a college degree, earning capacity, heredity, and "an exciting personality." They placed a relatively low value on housekeeping skills, and intelligence (Buss, 1990). Without this kind of information it would be easy for us to assume that people in other cultures look for the same qualities in their potential mates as we do. *(adapted from Understanding Human Behavior by Ronald Philipchalk)*

### Culture & Altruism

Ronald Johnson and George Danko (1989) report significant differences in altru­ism between cultures in , , , , the , and . Benjamin Colby reports that differences in altruism between stu­dents from 133 different cultures were predictive of their ability to adapt to university culture (altruistic students adapted better). In one study Wegner and Crano found that racial fac­tors affected helping behavior. An exper­i­menter who was apparently engrossed in examining a deck of 500 computer cards approached naive subjects. Approximately one step away from the subject, the experimenter "accidentally" dropped the entire deck. Blacks helped whites 17 percent of the time but they helped blacks 75 percent of the time. Whites helped both whites and blacks 44 percent of the time.

! *(Cross-cultural research seems particularly rele­vant to the topic of helping in that Jesus' point in the parable of the "Good Samaritan" was that cultural enemies, Jews and Samaritans, should love and help each other)*

### Altruism & Religion

The study of altruism or helping behavior also yields some interesting results with regard to the effects of religion. Research has consistently found that only a minority of people will stop to help someone who is clearly in need, especially if they are in a hurry themselves. Darley and Batson (1973) found that this was true even for seminary students, and *even when they were on their way to give a talk on the Good Samaritan.* Furthermore, they found that the most "religiously devout" were the least sensitive to the victims needs; when they did offer help, they often forced it on the victim even when he or she insisted on being left alone. Batson and Gray (1981) also found that the religiously devout tended to offer help when it was not wanted. Apparently if religion makes a difference it is not always good.

On the other hand, it should be noted that although only a minority of the seminarians stopped to help, they were *all* on their way to help the experimenter by giving a talk. Thus it was not a matter of helping or not, but a choice between which to help. If they stopped, they were led to believe, they would be late, and might endanger their ability to be of help to the experimenter.

In another setting, Perry London (1970) found Christian teaching often played a role in the justification given by those who helped hide Jews from the Nazis during World War II. Further research is needed before the role of religiousness in helping behavior can be determined. *(adapted from Psychology and Christianity by Ronald Philipchalk, pp. 219-220)*
