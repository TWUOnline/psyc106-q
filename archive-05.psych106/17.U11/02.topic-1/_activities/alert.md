## Learning Activities

####:fa-book: **Learning Activity 11.1: Read and Reflect**

For many people unfamiliar with the journey of counselling, finding suitable resources may feel daunting. It is important to know that there are many different approaches designed to help you accomplish the growth goals you have for your life. In this activity, the first resource, Psych Central is the oldest peer-reviewed psychology and mental health network on the Internet. Established in 1992, originally it was an index to mental health. Now it gives you the opportunity to see some treatment options for a wide variety of conditions. Additionally, there is a resource on different theoretical approaches to behavior change, and a link to some information concerning the integration of Christianity and psychotherapy.

#### **Learning Lab Preparation**

Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week's Learning Lab:

 - ***What is your view of the role of sin (or questionable moral behaviours) or other religious/spiritual beliefs in the treatment of psychological disorders?***
 - ***What kinds of religious/spiritual beliefs could lead to greater feelings of guilt/shame and increased psychological disorder?***
