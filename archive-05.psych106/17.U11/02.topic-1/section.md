## **Therapies - Part 1**

## Psychological Therapies
Psychological therapies, or psychotherapies, are a general class of therapies that deal with the psychological (mental/behavioural) world of people with disorders.

These therapies are generally contrasted with biomedical approaches, which deal more with the biological world of the individual. Biomedical therapies focus on altering a person's biology to effect a change in the person's psychology.

## Eclectic Approach

The eclectic approach is an approach that values the diversity of treatment approaches. Eclectic approaches deal with psychology and biology. In addition, various types of psychotherapies may be employed. Eclectic therapy approaches are becoming very popular.

## A Sin Problem?

*â€œMany Christians are not satisfied with viewing psychological disorders as either illnesses or nothing but thought and behavior problems. They feel that both of these approaches are inadequate because they omit very important moral and spiritual questions. Consequently, the important issue of moral responsibility is not dealt with adequately.

They feel that since humanity's most basic problem is alienation from God as a result of sin, no other difficulty can be dealt with until the relationship with God has been restored. Thus the first goal of therapy is to bring the client to the place of acknowledging his or her need, and asking for divine forgiveness through Jesus Christ. Once the client has placed his or her trust in God, and is operating within the same religious conceptual framework as the therapist, therapy can then proceed to the identification of specific disturbances of thought and behavior. These are seen as examples of sin in that the individual is either acting in a sinful way towards others, or is harboring sinful thoughts and attitudes within. The therapist will assist the individual to identify, confess, and forsake these sins. The goal of therapy is seen primarily in terms of spiritual growth and a "closer walk with God."*

## Sin Only?

In a work for Christian counselors, Koteskey (1983) gives the example of his eighteen month old son who developed an intense fear of dogs after two unpleasant experiences with them. Even the fact that the child was too young to talk did not prevent a fellow Christian psychologist from concluding that he had a spiritual problem. We should recognize that not every problem is necessarily a spiritual one. Just as a disturbance may have a purely biological cause, so too it may have a simple psychological (learning) explanation. Information gained from the study of animals may be helpful in the understanding of psychological problems as it is often vital in understanding biological problems. *(Both excerpts from Psychology and Christianity by Ronald Philipchalk)*
