#### :fa-question: ***Questions to Consider***

After you have read the first few pages of this chapter you should be able to answer the following questions:

  - ***How is the gender of an offspring determined?***
  - ***What differentiates zygotes from embryos and embryos from fetuses?***

*(These questions are intended for personal reflection - you are not intended to submit anything for assessment)*
