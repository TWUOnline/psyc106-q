#### **Learning Lab Preparation**

Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week's Learning Lab:

 - ***What is God like for children of different levels of cognitive development? If you can, give some examples from children you know....***
 - ***Would children even have an idea of God if they were not taught it?***
