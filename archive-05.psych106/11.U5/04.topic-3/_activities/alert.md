### Learning Activities

####:fa-pencil: **Learning Activity 5.3: Practice, Read, and Reflect**

In this topic we have continued to develop our understanding of personality. This will be the focus of this unit's Learning Lab. In order to prepare for discussion this week, take a moment to consider the following resource:

- [**Queendom.com**](https://www.queendom.com/)

*Queendom.com* is a great resource for different kinds of tests. You will be looking specifically at Personality tests on this site. When you go to www.queendom.com, click on the ***"TESTS, QUIZZES & POLLS"*** tab and select **TESTS.** From the ***PERSONALITY TESTS*** list select ONE of the following personality tests:

 - DISC Personality Test
 - Big Five Personality Test
 - Self-Control & Self-Monitoring Test
 - Happiness Test
 - Locus Of Control & Attributional Style Test

Then interact with the results and ponder whether or not you think the test is accurate or inaccurate and whether or not the information provided seems unique to you or could it be applied to anyone given the right situation.

#### **Learning Lab Preparation**

Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week's Learning Lab:

- ***What is the role of heredity in personality?***
- ***Is our personality inherited and set for life? Can it be modified?***

Author Tim LaHaye has taken the Greek idea of types and body humors and adapted it to a Christian perspective incorporating the concept of spiritual gifts.

- ***Does the bible support an approach to personality that links individual differences to inherited traits?***
- ***What is the role of the Holy Spirit in relationship to traits? Are these different “gifts” (I Cor. 12)? Different “fruit (Gal 5:22)? Can they be changed?***
