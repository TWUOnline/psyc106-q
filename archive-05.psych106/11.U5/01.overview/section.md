## **Unit 5: Personality**

### Overview

In Unit 5 of the course, our attention will focus on personality. The study of personality attempts to answer the questions: *Who are you?* and, *How did you become who you are?* As humanâ€™s are astoundingly complex, there is not any one theory that can capture, in totality, a description of who you are; hence, there are numerous approaches and theories that attempt to address these questions. In this unit, you will learn about some of the contemporary approaches to the study of Personality, and examine and review cultural, biological, Psychodynamic and Humanistic approaches to Personality.

### Topics:

This unit is divided into the following topics:

 1. Psychoanalytic View
 2. Humanistic View
 3. Trait View
 4. Social-Cognitive View 

### Learning Outcomes

 - Define the key terminology associated with contemporary approaches, cultural and biological approaches, and psychodynamic and humanistic approaches to personality.
