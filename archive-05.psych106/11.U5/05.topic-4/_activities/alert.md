### Learning Activities

####:fa-book: **Learning Activity 5.4: Read and Reflect**

Who we are is, in large part, shaped by the environment in which live. This will be the focus of this unit's Learning Lab. In order to prepare for discussion this week, take a moment to consider the following resources:

- [**Learned Helplessness**](http://www.ldonline.org/article/6154/)
- [**Learned Optimism Test**](https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande271/onlinetools/LearnedOpt.html)

The above resources will help you to think about how your environment can impact your sense of agency (the ability to choose your behaviours to impact the environment) and how your sense of agency can influence your environment. This demonstrates the key idea of Social-Cognitive Theory, that you are in a constant, dynamic relationship with your environment and each factor is shaped by the other.

Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week's Learning Lab:

*Research indicates that an internal locus of control is associated with more positive psychological outcomes than an external locus of control.*

- ***Does this mean that Christians (and others who believe in God) are less psychologically healthy because they believe an external force (God) is in control?***
