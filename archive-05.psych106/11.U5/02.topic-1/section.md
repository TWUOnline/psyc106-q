## **Psychoanalytic View**

  ! "We are sent into this world to acquire a personality and a character to take with us that can never be taken from us." *(In a letter from a WW II Royal Air Force pilot to his mother)*

### Personality Theories

In this chapter we consider the topic of personality theories. In doing this we examine several major perspectives. Within each of these there are many variations (e.g., Adler, Jung, and Freud within the psychoanalytic perspective). If you would like to know more about this area, you might be interested in taking the course “Theories of Personality” *(Psychology 301 at TWU).*

Aside from all these more formal theories, each of us has an implicit personality theory. This is our personal idea of what people are like, including which personality characteristics go together. For example, we think of people who are attractive and intelligent as likable rather than unlikable. Our socialization leads us to assume certain traits go together. As you go through this chapter, you may find some approaches are closer to your own assumptions (implicit theory), and you may prefer these approaches to others. You may also find your implicit theory becomes more explicit. Finally, you may even modify your own theory in the face of new information.

### Dreams

! “And afterward, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions” *(Joel 2:28)*.

God apparently spoke through dreams many times in the bible, and in Joel 2:28 He promised to do so in the future. Does God still (or again) speak through dreams? Are we missing out on a possible leading from God when we ignore our dreams? If you would like to read more on this subject you might be interested in books by Christians on this subject. For example, see John A. Sanford's Dreams, God's Forgotten Language, or Morton T. Kelsey's God, Dreams, and Revelation, or Abraham Schmitt’s Before I Wake. The website below (cf. Online Resources) contains some balanced advice. Also, voice your opinion or give your experience in the online discussion.

### Birth Order

You may be familiar with Adler's concept of the family constellation, which implies that position in the family has a powerful effect on goals, self-concept, and ways of relating to others.

As a test of this concept, think of a three-child family, all of whom were born within a few years (using larger families makes things too complicated). Try applying Adler's theory to predict which child in the family is likely to be:

- the best student
- the most shy
- the most helpful around the house
- the most outgoing
- the "hell raiser"
- the most "helpless"
- the charmer
- the "baby" of the family

You will not always be right—but neither was Adler. The important thing is to note that Adler made psychology aware of the different expectations and social influences on different children in the same family. In some respects, children in the same position in different families are more alike than are children in differ­ent positions in the same family
