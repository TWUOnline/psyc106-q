#### **Learning Lab Preparation**

Consider the following scenario (and questions) as you continue to prepare for this unit's Learning Lab. You will be asked to share your thoughts so come prepared!

- ***What is different about these two claims that makes us accept one and not the other? Is it the role of nature versus nurture? Or is it more closely tied to the high value our culture places on intelligence, and especially IQ scores?***
- ***If IQ were unimportant would it matter if one racial or gender group tended to score higher than another group? Would you be considered racist or sexist for suggesting this?***
