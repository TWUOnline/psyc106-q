## **Extremes of Intelligence**

### IQ Testing

In this section we continue to build upon our understanding of intelligence and testing to focus on Intelligence tests and those who score at the "extremes." Intelligence tests are the most common tool used to measure intelligence. Intelligence test are one method of assessing an individual’s mental aptitudes and comparing them with those of others using numerical scores. These scores are then plotted on a normal (bell) curve to estimate where a person’s intelligence rates in relation to a standardized population. The extremes of intelligence is the understanding that on one end of the continuum are those with intellectual disabilities and on the other end are those who are geniuses.
