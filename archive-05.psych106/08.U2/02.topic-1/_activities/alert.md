### Learning Activity

####:fa-pencil: **Learning Activity 2.1: Intelligence Testing**

In this unit we investigated Intelligence Testing. One of the important concepts we learned was that Intelligence Testing can be controversial due to its socially constructed nature.

Below is a link to a website that will allow you to take some Intelligence Tests for yourself. As you work through each test, and see the results, think about why we might consider these types of tests beneficial, and why they might be considered controversial.

#### **Learning Lab Preparation**

Our Learning Lab for this unit will focus on Intelligence Testing. As we have seen, Intelligence Testing is best implemented after careful consideration - this will be the focus of our discussion during this unit's Learning Lab. To help you prepare, consider the following questions:

- ***How do you feel about the EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE TESTS? Did you learn anything? If so, what were the important areas that were illumined by the test?***
- ***Is ‘emotional intelligence’ a valid concept worth measuring?***
- ***Do you believe E-IQ is more important than "intelligence" as measured by IQ scores for success and happiness in your life?”***
