## **Final Exam**

In addition to your Term Paper, student's will also be responsible for completing a final exam for Psych 106.

The final exam will be a culmination of everything we have learned throughout the course. It is a good idea to review course notes as well as the textbook. The "Key Terms Quizzes" might also be useful to help you identify sections that may require additional review.

The structure of this exam will be multiple choice. There will be 100 questions and you will be given one hour and forty minutes (100 minutes) to complete it.

Your instructor will provide additional information regarding delivery of the quiz.
