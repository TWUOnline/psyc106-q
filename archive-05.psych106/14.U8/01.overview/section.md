## **Unit 8: Health**

### Overview

In Unit 8, you will examine what factors contribute to one’s general health. In Unit 9 you will gain more insight into stress and coping. Together, Units 8 and 9 span information from Chapter 14 in your textbook, giving you a broad overview of the field of health psychology.

Health psychologists study both positive and negative impacts that humans’ behaviour and decisions have on their health, survival, and well-being. The need for this field has increased considerably over the 20th century, as most premature deaths are attributable to lifestyle factors. Over this chapter you will gain knowledge about the interaction of all the levels of analysis (biological, psychological, sociocultural, and spiritual) with regards to your health. You will learn about the biological/physiological responses to stress and how a poor response to stress leaves a person more vulnerable to illness and slowing recovery time from illness and injury. How having at least some degree of control helps people with coping and outlook. When control is threatened, people use compensatory responses, such as detecting order within random images. You will also be informed that coping using a positive or negative style is related to personality (e.g., optimism versus pessimism). And, that positive coping increases resilience—the ability to recover from adversity, and even benefit from the experience, as is the case with post-traumatic growth. Whereas, coping via negative affectivity and pessimism can have both psychological and physiological disadvantages. Lastly, you’ll be advised as to how religion/spirituality, relaxation techniques, meditation, and biofeedback actually help people cope with stress and problems which can lead to human flourishing.
