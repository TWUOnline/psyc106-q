## **Communicating Emotion**

By now you know something about the physical responses involved in emotions, and you have given some thought to our responses to our emotions. However, a very important part of the study of emotions is the way that we *communicate* them. “I feel angry,” we say. But the way we say it also carries a message. Just stop for a minute and think about how many different ways ("channels" communication experts call them) we use to communicate emotions. We use our faces, our bodies, the tone and volume of our voice; in writing we use words but we also use punctuation marks (!?). And what about e-mail? How many ways can you find that we use to show our emotions in e-mail? *(Hint: What are emoticons?)*

### How Many Facial Expressions?

The study of emotion has long been linked with the study of facial expressions. Psychologists have been interested in the way in which people express emotion and whether these facial expressions reliably convey the emotional message. Stud­ies by Ekman and others have raised a contemporary interest in emotional expression. It appears that there are some universal aspects of emotion across a number of cul­tures. Seven emotions have been consistently identified: happi­ness, sadness, anger, disgust, contempt, fear, and surprise. However, questions remain about whether this is a complete spectrum of emotion and whether there are cul­ture-specific aspects of facial emotion expression. What can you find on the internet concerning the number of possible facial emotional expressions?
