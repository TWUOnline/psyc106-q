## **Topic 1: What is Psychology**

We begin our course with a quick challenge: ***In your own words, define "psychology."***

According to your definition, how is psychology different from other academic areas that would study humans (*for example, philosophy, literature, or history*)? If you said "Pyschology is different because it uses the scientific method" - give yourself a pat on the back!

You will begin your study of the scientific method by reading your textbook. The parable below (*from Philipchalk's Social Psychology textbook*), however, helps illustrate the scientific method with three "helpful" approaches to a problem, including a simple experiment:

 ! *Once upon a time there were three brothers. One day while they were working in their father's field, they saw an old man coming along the road. The old man greeted them, and then struggled on along the road, limping terribly. After that, every day at the same time, the brothers greeted the old man and watched as he hobbled by. When a month had passed, they were so impressed that they each did something. The first brother wrote a compelling story about perseverance in the face of the ravages of old age. It encouraged many people. The second brother painted a moving portrait of the old man, stooped over and limping along. People were inspired. The third brother, who had observed the old man very closely, asked him one day if he could exchange shoes with him. The old man was surprised, but he gladly agreed. When the old man walked away he did not limp. The next day the third brother gave the old man his shoes back and watched as he limped on his way. On the third day, the brother again exchanged shoes with the old man. Then he took the old man's shoes to a shoemaker and had them repaired. When the brother gave them back to the old man he was delighted. The old man put on the shoes, thanked the brother, and walked away without a limp.*

Although each brother made a positive contribution, the third brother solved the man's problem because he discovered its cause. To do this, ***he used the scientific method and he conducted an experiment (Philipchalk, 1994).***

I think psychology is one of the most interesting areas of study there is, first, because it studies people, people like you and me, and we’re interesting! Second, I like psychology because it is so broad. Psychologists, as you will soon see, study everything from nerve conduction in single cells, all the way to the influence of groups on our behaviour—and everything in between. Finally, psychologists don’t just speculate and theorize, they look for evidence for their ideas. If they don’t find sufficient evidence, they change their ideas; and I like that. Which leads us back to the scientific method and how psychology began.
