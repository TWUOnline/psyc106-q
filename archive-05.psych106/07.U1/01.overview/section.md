## **Unit 1: Thought and Language**

### Overview

***Welcome to Psych 106!***

We begin this course by reviewing some important information on scientific research methodologies. While this review will be self-guided, it is critical that you understand the important elements that constitute valid and reliable scientific research as it is these methodologies that serve as the backbone for psychological studies.

After taking time to review scientific research methodologies, we will turn our attention to the subject of Thought and Language. Developing an understanding of Thought and Language helps us better understand how we think, how we organize our thoughts and our knowledge of the world around us, and how we communicate and act out on this information.
