### Learning Activities

####:fa-book: **Read and Reflect**

In addition to the content above, you are also responsible for reading through the following:

*Krause et. al (2018). Revel for An Introduction to Psychological Science, 2nd Canadian Edition. Chapter 8*

!!! While all of these pages may not relate directly to this unit’s discussion, consistent reading will help you keep pace, as well as provide necessary background knowledge when you need it.

####:fa-pencil: **Learning Activity 1.2: Problem Solving Activity**

In this lesson, we spent time exploring cognitive strategies used to solve problems and make decisions. We now have an opportunity to practice this on our own! Take a look at the following problems and see if you can find a solution. As you work through the problems, think about what cognitive strategies you are implementing as you make each decision:

***Problem A***

- Take a look at the following Roman Numeral: **IX**
- Now add one line to the Roman numeral **IX** to make it six

<details>
  <summary><b>Click here for the solution.</b></summary>
    <p>The answer is to add a curved line shaped like an "S" (i.e., "SIX"). In writing, the problem looks simple, but you might want to try it aloud on a friend. There is a mental set that one must add a straight line and have some form of Roman numeral on the page.</p>

***Problem B***

Your task is to plant trees on Arbor Day. You have ten trees that must be planted in five rows of four trees each. How would you plant the trees?

<details>
  <summary><b>Click here for the solution.</b></summary>
    <p>The answer is that you would arrange them at the vertices and cross-points of a 5-pointed star</p>

####:fa-pencil: **Learning Activity 1.3: Problem Solving Practice**

Below is a website that provides more opportunity to work through, and solve, some problems. Specifically, this resource explores the idea of ***Assumptions*** and the role assumptions play when solving problems. Furthermore, this is a valuable resource as it also explores other important techniques to be implemented when solving problems.

Click on the following link and read through the information as you continue to practice your problem solving:

#### **Learning Lab Preparation**

Your Learning Lab for this unit will focus on group discussion as explore the topics of this unit in more detail. As you prepare for your Learning Lab, one possible scenario that discussion will focus on is below - please prepare some thoughts to share with the group:

!!! In the largest sense, society is breaking into two classes:
!!!
!!! *The first class are people who know how to think. These people realize that most problems are open to examination and creative solution. If a problem appears in the lives of these people, their intellectual training will quickly lead them to a solution or an alternative statement of the problem. These people are the source of the most important product in today's economy – ideas.*
!!!
!!! *The second class, the vast majority of society, are people who cannot think for themselves. I call these people ‘idea consumers’ – metaphorically speaking, they wander around in a gigantic open-air mall of facts and ideas. The content of their experience is provided by television, the Internet and other shallow data pools. These people believe collecting images and facts makes them educated and competent, and all their experiences reinforce this belief. The central, organizing principle of this class is that ideas come from somewhere else, from magical persons, geniuses, ‘them.’*

Consider the following prompts to help better prepare for the discussion:

 - ***Do you agree or disagree with this claim?***
 - ***Do you know people that fit in the second category? What causes this difference? How might it be changed?***
