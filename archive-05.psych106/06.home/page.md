### Course Structure

Each unit will support your understanding of Psychology. There are supplemental readings and resources that are intended to promote additional understanding of the topics we will explore. While these resources will not be formally evaluated, they help you pursue your passion of certain topics.

Each unit will also have a Learning Lab in which you are expected to participate. You will notice that the focus of these Learning Labs will be on exploring guiding questions provided throughout each unit. It is hoped that you participate and share your insights so that the entire class can benefit from your understanding. A facilitator will work closely with the instructor - they will also be responsible for assigning a participation mark based on your engagement.
