## Assessment

In addition to your participation in this unit's Learning Lab, you will also be responsible for two formal assessments. The first, is your **Writing Assignment #2** - more information can be found on this assignment by scrolling down the page. The second assessment that will take place is your second quiz - again, more information can be found by scrolling down the page.

! *Active participation in group exercises, reflection, and critical discourse is an essential component of this course. You are expected to show respect for all members of the course, both in your speech and actions. Contribute by actively observing and listening, raising thoughtful questions, examining relevant issues, building on others’ ideas, analyzing and evaluating the group’s thinking, synthesizing key points, and expanding the group’s perspectives. Take care not to dominate a conversation, giving space for others to speak. When in small groups help maintain the focus, flow, and quality of conversations, and take the initiative to invite others (particularly those who are quiet) to speak.*

## **Writing Assignment #2**

Your second writing assignment for the course will involve reading a formal research article and extracting important information. Research articles play an important role in the field of psychology as they present new findings and research that help us better understand the subject field. It is critical, however, to understand what information is important as we assess the value of the article we are reading. This assignment attempts to help us better understand those considerations.

Prior to moving ahead, it is strongly encouraged that you take a moment to review the [**How to Read Empirical Articles**](Assessment_Empirical_Short.pdf) reading from the first writing assignment - this will serve as a reminder *why* you are reading an article so you can better understand *what* is important to get out of it.

Building upon that, also take some time to review [**How to Read a Journal Article in Social Psychology**](Assessment_Empirical_Long.pdf) - this article will help support your understanding of formal, empirical research journal articles.

#### ***Finally...***

After reviewing the resources above, we begin this assignment by reading the following article:

[**Pathways Linking Early Socioeconomic Adversity to Diverging Profiles of Romantic Relationship Dissolution in Young Adulthood**](Romantic_Relationship_Dissolution_in_Young_Adulthood.pdf)
