#### **Learning Lab Preparation**

Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week's Learning Lab:

- ***Each of us has some minor annoyances that add to our stress level more than they should. What gets you stressed out? What are your everyday "pet peeves" (annoyances)? Does the stress that these things produce seem justified? What are some things you can do to decreases your stress responses to these situations?***
