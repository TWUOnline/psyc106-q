## Aggression, Submission, and Assertion

Much of the stress we experience comes from problems we have with other peo¬ple. Unfortunately, many people see only two alternatives in dealing with interper¬sonal conflict: aggression or submission. Are there other ways?
Assertiveness represents a third alternative but one that is often confused with aggression. Assertive statements are not attacks. Rather, they communi¬cate one's own perceptions and emotions. Such responses often take the form of "***I-statements***": I feel _________ when you do _________. Being assertive tends to defuse conflict situations because it gives both parties more complete information to work with—so it helps alleviate stress.
