### Learning Activities

####:fa-book: **Learning Activity 4.2: Read and Reflect**

In this section we reach the end of life. Discussing death and dying can be difficult for many reasons. This activity has six resources to help your understanding of aging and the inevitability of death. *Do not feel the need to examine all six links closely, but I would encourage you to read more deeply into the sites you find interesting:*

#### **Learning Lab Preparation**

Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week's Learning Lab:

 - ***How do react to the thought of your inevitable death?***
 - ***Do your religious beliefs make a difference?***
 - ***Is death ever easy? What concerns do you have about your death? Pain? Those left behind? The unknown? Unfinished business?***
