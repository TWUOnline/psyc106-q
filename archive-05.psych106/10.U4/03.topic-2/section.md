## **Death and Dying**

### Death

Secular psychologists see death as final. Christians, however, see resurrection beyond, with death being but another step in that direction. What implications do these beliefs have for the process of dying?

As medical technology has advanced death has become more and more difficult to define. We need to focus our attention less on preserving the physical and more on preserving the personhood of the individual. This means giving greater attention to our concept of the dying person created in the image of God (as the abortion issue has forced us to do at the other end of life). When is personhood sacrificed to technical efficiency? Should we advocate a more "natural death?" What is "natural death?" How far does one go in "allowing" natural death? *(from Psychology and Christianity, by Ronald Philipchalk, p. 146)*

### Hospice

! You matter because of who you are. You matter to the last moment of your life, and we will do all we can not only to help you die peacefully, but also to live until you die.” *(Dame Cicely Saunders)*


During the Crusades of the Middle Ages a hospice provided lodging for travelers: a place of refuge and comfort. So in 1967, when Dame Cicley Saunders opened a facility in London to provide care and comfort to dying people and their families, St. Christopher’s hospice was an appropriate name. *(Courtesy of the Langley Hospice Society)*

- Stage theories may not apply in other cultures

- The "social clock" may be set differently in other cultures
- Attitudes toward death vary greatly between cultures
