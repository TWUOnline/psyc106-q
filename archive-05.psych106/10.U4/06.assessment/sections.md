## Assessment

In addition to your participation in this unit's Learning Lab, you will also be responsible for two formal assessments. The first, is your **Writing Assignment #1** - more information can be found on this assignment by scrolling down the page. The second assessment that will take place is **Quiz #1** - more information can be found by scrolling down the page.

! *Active participation in group exercises, reflection, and critical discourse is an essential component of this course. You are expected to show respect for all members of the course, both in your speech and actions. Contribute by actively observing and listening, raising thoughtful questions, examining relevant issues, building on others’ ideas, analyzing and evaluating the group’s thinking, synthesizing key points, and expanding the group’s perspectives. Take care not to dominate a conversation, giving space for others to speak. When in small groups help maintain the focus, flow, and quality of conversations, and take the initiative to invite others (particularly those who are quiet) to speak.*

## **Writing Assignment #1**

Your first assignment for the course will involve reading a formal research article and extracting important information. Research articles play an important role in psychology as they present new findings and research that help us better understand the subject field. It is, however, important for us to understand what information is important as we weigh the value of the article we are reading. This assignment attempts to help us better understand those considerations.

Your first task is to read [**How to Read Empirical Articles**](Assessment_Empirical_Short.pdf)

As you can see, it is important to understand ***why*** you are reading an article and it is important to understand ***what*** you want to get out of it.

Next, your task is to read [**How to Read a Journal Article in Social Psychology**](Assessment_Empirical_Long.pdf)

 - This article should help support your understanding of formal research articles and how to read them to support your research and learning.

#### **Writing Assignment**

Finally, it is time to apply what we have learned. Download the following article:
