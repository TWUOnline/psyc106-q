## Assessment

In addition to your participation in this unit's Learning Lab, you will also be responsible for completing **Quiz #3** - more information can be found by scrolling down to the bottom of the page.

! *Active participation in group exercises, reflection, and critical discourse is an essential component of this course. You are expected to show respect for all members of the course, both in your speech and actions. Contribute by actively observing and listening, raising thoughtful questions, examining relevant issues, building on others’ ideas, analyzing and evaluating the group’s thinking, synthesizing key points, and expanding the group’s perspectives. Take care not to dominate a conversation, giving space for others to speak. When in small groups help maintain the focus, flow, and quality of conversations, and take the initiative to invite others (particularly those who are quiet) to speak.*
