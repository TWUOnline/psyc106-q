## **Final Assessments**

As mentioned in the previous units, student's will be responsible for completing two final formal assessment. This page will provide an outline of what is expected for your Term Paper.

### Term Paper

The first of your final assessments will be to submit a term paper. This term paper will require you to call upon information you have learned throughout the entire course - in particular, this term paper will continue to build upon the skills you applied in writing your **Writing Assignment #1** and **Writing Assignment #2** submissions. Additional resources will be provided at the bottom of this page - they are intended to support the development of your paper.

#### Assignment Overview

As Christians and as psychologists, it is crucial that we are able to critically evaluate psychological research. The main purpose of this assignment is to provide you with an opportunity to utilize your skills in research design and analysis as well as to practice your interpretation and critical analysis skills. You will also begin to utilize formatting guidelines specific to an academic discipline. In this case, you will use those provided by the American Psychological Association (APA).

### ***STEP 1: Choose an Article***

Select one of the following topics from the course. Topics include language development, social roles and obedience, ADHD & Autism, emotional intelligence, and cognitive behavioral therapy. You should familiarize yourself with the topic by browsing through the textbook and lecture notes (if we have already covered it in class).
You should then search for a journal article of interest to you that falls within this topic. You should identify this article as being either a true experiment or a non-experiment. Using *PSYCInfo* via the TWU library website, use keywords to search for articles. More details on how to do this will be provided in class. Choose articles that you find interesting and are able to understand. Some articles can be jargon-filled and complicated, so it is in your best interest to choose one that you will be able to read and write about.

### ***STEP 2: Summarize Your Article***

After reading the article, you should begin to summarize the main points. Just as you would describe the study if you were having a casual conversation with someone, you should summarize the study so that it is brief and easy to understand. You should summarize the article in your own words. Copying sections from the article is considered to be plagiarism. A description of each section of an article is provided below:

*Introduction*

In their introduction, the author(s) will describe previous research. In your summary indicate the main findings of that previous research. Additionally, in the introduction the author(s) will describe the purpose of the study they conducted and how it relates to the previous research. In your summary you should identify the question that the author(s) were trying to answer and the hypotheses they were evaluating.`
