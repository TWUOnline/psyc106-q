## **Biological Treatments**

Though there are a number of treatments options within the field of psychology, there are two basic treatment models:

 1. The Wellness Model
 2. The Medical Model.

The Wellness Model will look intently, and holistically, at a number of areas of a person’s life (thoughts/emotions, relationships, work/academics, developmental stage, nutrition, activity/leisure, and sleep, to name a few) and illuminate the client’s strengths and resources to help them find a way to overcome challenges and lead a more fulfilling life. Many of the psychotherapeutic approaches looked at, thus far, operate on this model.

The Medical Model, however,  is based on symptom recognition, (differential) diagnosis, prognosis, and often a pharmacological support and possibly an invasive or non-invasive procedure. The topic of biological treatments is based on the medical model.

## Medical Treatments

Although psychotherapy in its various forms has grown in importance over the past generation, people are still more inclined to seek the help of medical professionals over mental health professionals for their psychological concerns. One of the greatest changes in the way we have treated psychological disorders has been through the discovery and use of various drugs. In this section, we consider the various biomedical therapies that are available for psychological disorders.

## Not a Panacea

All of the biological therapies produce side effects, some of them permanent. Since the brain cannot regenerate itself, psychosurgery is irreversible; ECT destroys brain cells, producing memory loss, some of which is permanent; virtually all drugs have side effects besides the dependency produced, and some of these are permanent. (For example, one class of antipsychotic drugs, the phenothiazines, can produce a permanent and irreversible muscle disorder, particularly after massive long-term use. This disorder, called tardive dyskinesia, is evidenced by involuntary movements of the face, limbs, and trunk.) Furthermore, the unknown basis of the effects of many of these techniques (e.g., ECT, and some drugs), and the exploratory nature of others (psychosurgery) should make us at least a little skeptical. (A further controversy surrounding the use of physiological therapies, particularly, ECT, concerns their forced administration to involuntary patients.)
