## Learning Activities

####:fa-book: **Learning Activity 12.3: Read and Reflect**

Looking intently at how you are spending your time and taking preventative steps to contribute to your mental/emotional health and overall well-being is a great gift to give to yourself (and ultimately others). This activity offers a resource where you can find information on a variety of (usually research-based) preventative strategies. Moreover, if you decide that you would like to explore therapy for yourself, there are resources here to inform you as to how to find a suitable therapist and what some of your rights and responsibilities are in therapy.

#### **Learning Lab Preparation**

Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week's Learning Lab:

- ***What role do your religious or other beliefs play in your efforts to avoid psychological difficulties and promote growth?***

- ***Do your beliefs affect your choice of the kind of help you would look for?***
