## **Unit 10: Psychological Disorders**

### Overview

Whether due to sheer fascination with the unusual, or perhaps just personal curiosity, many introductory psychology students look forward to learning about psychological disorders. Abnormal human behavior is a universal part of human history. In this unit you will learn about past and current perspectives on how to recognize and understand various psychopathologies and the numerous challenges that often accompany disorders. I would encourage you to refrain from diagnosing yourself, or others, while you are covering the information involved with this chapter. It will be tempting, especially with the checklist style presentation of some of the material, however; to offer an appropriate diagnosis of someone, you will need to obtain a minimum of a masterâ€™s degree in clinical or counselling psychology.  

### Topics

This unit will be divided into the following topics:

 1. Looking at What is Normal and Anxiety Disorders
 2. Mood Disorders
 3. Schizophrenia
 4. Personality Disorders

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this unit, student's will be able to:

- Define the key terminology associated with classifying psychological disorders, personality and dissociative disorders, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and depressive disorders, and schizophrenia.
- Describe advantages and criticisms associated with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).
- Apply your knowledge of the mental disorders defense to decide if defendants are criminally responsible for their actions.
- Analyze whether the benefits of labelling psychological disorders outweigh the disadvantages, the status of dissociative identity disorder as a legitimate diagnosis, and whether maladaptive aspects of specific phobias might arise from perfectly normal, healthy behaviours.
- Apply your knowledge of antisocial personality disorder to explain how it could help people succeed in certain professions.
- Describe the different types of anxiety disorders and how anxiety or depressive disorders can be self-perpetuating.
- Apply your knowledge of anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and depressive disorders, to be alert to people who might benefit from some help, and to be able to identify different forms of schizophrenia.
- Describe how different neurotransmitters affect individuals with schizophrenia and the genetic and environmental contributions to this disorder.
- Analyze claims that schizophrenia is related to genius or violent behaviour.
