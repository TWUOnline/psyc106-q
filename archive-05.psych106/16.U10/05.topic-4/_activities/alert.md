## Learning Activities

####:fa-book: **Activity 10.4: Read and Reflect**

Recall from Chapter 12 that our personalities allow others to predict and anticipate our responses to situations. A person with a “healthy” personality demonstrates a range of coping responses and styles when placed in a stressful situation. However, a disordered personality does not have this kind of adaptability and flexibility. At times, the person doesn’t feel they like they have any problems, at other times, the lack of adaptability and the limited repertoire of coping responses can result in distress for the person and for those around him or her. In this activity, you can gain more insight into defined patterns of personality disorders.

#### **Learning Lab Preparation**

Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week's Learning Lab:

 - ***Do you ever wonder if someone you know seems to have a personality disorder? What are some indications that you have seen that make you curious if there may be a problem? (If you don’t know anyone personally, you can describe someone you know about or have seen in a movie/TV show.)***
