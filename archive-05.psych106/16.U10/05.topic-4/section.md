## **Personality Disorders**

Personality disorders are relatively common disorders where the person can function normally, but shows evidence of some difficulty or abnormality in social functioning. Unlike other disorders, the person does not seem to feel there is a difficulty.

## Antisocial Personality

Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD) is a pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others. It can be seen in individuals who have a profound lack of empathy or emotional connection with others, a disregard for others’ rights or preferences, and a tendency toward imposing their own desires, often violently, onto others regardless of the consequences for other people or, often when younger, other animals. APD (sometimes referred to as psychopathy) tends to be highly resistant to treatment, in part because individuals with APD are not alarmed or distressed by their actions (although others frequently are), and they are thus rarely, if ever, motivated to change. The following is a short example to illustrate how some people who suffer from APD might present themselves:

A former professor at UBC, Dr. Robert Hare (an internationally known expert on antisocial personality disorders) often conducted research with prisoners diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder. He frequently took graduate students with him to prison to assist in this research. To illustrate the ability of the prisoners to “con” even bright graduate students, he told them that on the way back from prison inevitably the students would tell him that the prisoner they had been dealing with was innocent. They were sure there had been a mistake, and the prisoner had been falsely convicted. Such is the charm and persuasive power of the antisocial personality.
