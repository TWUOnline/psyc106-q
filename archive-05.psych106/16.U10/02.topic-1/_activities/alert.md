## Learning Activities

Due to the pervasiveness of disorders, especially anxiety related problems, this information could prove invaluable in helping yourself and others find hope and help in challenging circumstances. There is also an excellent write up on the many valid criticisms of being overly dependent on the DSM as a resource.

 - ***What about people with no religious/spiritual beliefs?***
