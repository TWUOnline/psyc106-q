## **Mood Disorders**

Before we consider mood disorders, take moment to read through the following case:

 ! *Jane (not her real name) was a married church-going woman. She seemed to live a normal, uneventful life. Her family, however, was living a private hell. At times, Jane would be so depressed that she didn’t want to get out of bed. She would mope around the house. She didn’t want to see anyone or visit anyone. Her children and husband tried to lift her spirits, but their efforts were all in vain. She believed she was worthless, useless, and her life was meaningless. At other times, Jane was the life of the party. She would make great plans to change the world. She would give huge sums of money to charity and she would go on pointless, spending frenzies. Her husband was forced to cancel their credit cards for fear of personal bankruptcy. When Jane found out about the cards being cancelled she reacted violently. She told her husband that he was old, ugly and worthless, and that she could be with anyone she wanted. In fact, she stated that all the young men are staring at her—"If I wasn’t a committed Christian, I’d be leave you to be with one of those young men, they all want me." Her family could no longer stand Jane’s mood swings—she was either "pathetic" or "unbearable". After years of mood fluctuations, Jane was finally diagnosed as suffering from Bipolar Mood Disorder. Following medical treatment and counselling, Jane’s moods stabilized and the family was again able to live peacefully.*

## Depression

Depression is one of the most common psychological problems of all—striking Christians and non-Christians alike. Mental health workers sometimes refer to it as “the common cold” of psychological disorders.

In depression we once again see the link between normal and abnormal behavior. We all feel sad or down sometimes. A diagnosis of depression, however, is an extreme and continuing sadness. You will see more about the criteria for this diagnosis in the textbook and the online resources.

## Heartsick

*Depression Hurts the Heart!*

Experts have long thought depression could be bad for your heart. A new study demonstrates just how dangerous it can be. Brenda Penninx, a gerontologist at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., and colleagues followed 2,847 people over 55—both with and without heart disease—for four years to trace the effects of depression.

In the end, people with major depression were at least three times as likely as patients who were not depressed to die of heart disease. Even subjects with mild depression experienced a fatality rate that was 50 percent higher than normal.

  ! *Penninx isn’t sure exactly what the connection is, but since depression can raise stress, and stress triggers an outpouring of the hormone cortisol, this could cause heart rate and blood pressure to rise. Other factors could play a part: Depressed people are less likely to exercise or eat right than those who don’t suffer from the malady. “Depression deserves a lot more attention than it usually gets,” Penninx warns. "It’s a huge cardiac risk factor, so it’s crucial to take care of your emotions.""* —Health (Quoted in Readers Digest, Feb. 2002, p. 27)*
