## Learning Activities

####:fa-book: **Learning Activity 10.2: Read and Reflect**

How do you know the difference between depression and normal sadness? In this activity, you are given an overview of depression  that explains the causes, describes the diagnostic criteria, and offers some treatment options. Additionally, though children may suffer from a disorder, there are additional challenges in noticing it in them due to their immature language, cognitive, and emotion processing abilities and developmental stage. The second resource provides an overview of recognizing the signs that a child is struggling due to a disorder.

#### **Learning Lab Preparation**

Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week's Learning Lab:

 - ***Can you think of some examples of biblical characters that apparently suffered from a mood disorder? Describe their behavior?***
 - ***What do their examples suggest about possible causes? (Hint: Elijah, David, Saul, others?)***

*If you are not familiar with biblical personages, give an example from literature or contemporary public life.*
