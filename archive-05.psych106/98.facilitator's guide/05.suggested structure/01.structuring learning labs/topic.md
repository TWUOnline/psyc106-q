### Suggested Time for Different Online or In Class Lab Activities

As a facilitator, you may need to lead your students in face-to-face interactions, whether online or in a classroom, for up to 2 hours or more. Fortunately, there are numerous questions posed through each of the Units and many ways to address those questions. Below are some suggested timelines for the various activities you can do to enhance student interaction and learning. At the same time, please use your discretion to avoid unnecessarily ending an activity that is going well, or prolonging an activity that requires changing. The activities can be conducted as individual or group exercises. (Please note that “question(s)” is used to allow the opportunity to bundle two or more questions together, when appropriate.)

Drawing a picture – 15 to 30 minutes of drawing, 5 to 10 minutes of discussion per person as to how the drawing relates to the question(s)

Designing a game – 15 to 30 minutes of designing, up to 30 minutes of playing the game (this is dependent upon how many games are made and how many people are in the class)
