### Bonus Activity - Book of Mark Reflections (Up to 5 Bonus Marks)

In order to understand the leadership of Jesus more fully, it is helpful to go back to one of the closest sources at the time Jesus was on earth to read first and second-hand accounts of what Jesus actually said and did that made his leadership so unique.  In each unit there are assigned 1-2 chapters from the book of Mark in the New Testament scriptures. Reading those chapters alongside the textbooks and the lecture material will provide students with a fuller picture of how Jesus demonstrated life changing leadership to those he encountered.

For extra credit, students can write up to 5 short reflections, worth 1 bonus mark each, based on the unit readings assigned. They can submit a journal type reflection response that includes their observations and critical evaluations to the following three prompts:

*1. What key words or phrases did I notice that intrigued or confused me? Discuss.*
*2. What event or interaction between Jesus and another person did I observe that taught me about a specific servant leadership principle?*
*3. One idea I could apply to my life and leadership right now is ____.*
