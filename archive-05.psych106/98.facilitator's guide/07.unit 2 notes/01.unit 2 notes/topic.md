## Unit 2: Intelligence Testing

***Topic 1***

Topic 1 will introduce intelligence (what it is). In addition, student's will also explore different types of intelligence. The Learning Activity will provide student's with the opportunity complete their own intelligence tests and reflect on the outcome. In addition, student's are also asked to consider:

- How do you feel about the EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE TESTS? Did you learn anything? If so, what were the important areas that were illumined by the test?
- Is ‘emotional intelligence’ a valid concept worth measuring?
- Do you believe E-IQ is more important than "intelligence" as measured by IQ scores for success and happiness in your life?”

***Topic 2***

This section focuses on IQ Testing. Student's will be given the opportunity to take some IQ Tests and, once again, consider the "meaning" of the outcomes. In addition, student's are asked to consider the following:

The Bible says, in James; Chapter 2:

*My brothers, as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, don't show favoritism. Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in. If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, "Here's a good seat for you," but say to the poor man, "You stand there" or "Sit on the floor by my feet," have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?*

- Could we be guilty of favoritism in esteeming more intelligent people above less intelligent people? In society? In Church?

***Topic 3***

Finally, Topic 3 explores the idea of Nature-Nature and IQ - specifically, the challenge around test biases.

After exploring the content, student's will be provided with a short quiz to test their own understanding of some important terms. Please remind student's that this quiz is NOT GRADED.

Student's will also be asked to consider the following (and discuss the questions below):

*If you suggest that Asians have darker skin than Caucasians, you are not considered racist; this is an obvious fact with a genetic basis. However, if you suggest that Asians are more intelligent than Caucasians (as IQ tests show), or that African Americans are less intelligent, watch out!*

- What is different about these two claims that makes us accept one and not the other? Is it the role of nature versus nurture? Or is it more closely tied to the high value our culture places on intelligence, and especially IQ scores?

- If IQ were unimportant would it matter if one racial or gender group tended to score higher than another group? Would you be considered racist or sexist for suggesting this?
