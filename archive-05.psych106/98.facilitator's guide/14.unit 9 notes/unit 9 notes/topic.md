## Unit 9: Stress and Coping

Unit 9 is the second half of Chapter 14 and expands upon our studies in Unit 8.

***Topic 1***

Topic one is a study on stress. Here, student's will begin by completing a personal reflection on difference way to respond to stress.

In additions, student's will consider the following:

- Each of us has some minor annoyances that add to our stress level more than they should. What gets you stressed out? What are your everyday "pet peeves" (annoyances)? Does the stress that these things produce seem justified? What are some things you can do to decreases your stress responses to these situations?

***Topic 2***

Student's turn their attention to health psychology. Student's will need to watch a video and read an article on stress and healthy coping skills.

Learning activities will include a key terms quiz - please ensure student's understand that this is ungraded.

Student's will also be asked to consider:

- Who is ultimately responsible for how you react to different situations and circumstances in your life? How do you know this?
- Is there a good time to just laugh something off?
- What are some potential stress related consequences of habitually turning to humour when dealing with stress?

!! Please remind student's that they are also responsible for their Quiz #2 and Writing Assignment #2 upon completion of this unit.
