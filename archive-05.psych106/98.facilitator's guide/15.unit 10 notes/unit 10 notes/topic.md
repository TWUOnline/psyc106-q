## Unit 10: Psychological Disorders

Unit 10 focuses on Chapter 15 and explores psychological disorders.

***Topic 1***

Topic one is a study on anxiety disorders and how a disorder differs from "normal" anxiety.

Student's will consider the following:

- Would you expect Christians to be more mentally healthy than non-Christians? Why or why not?
- What about people with other religious/spiritual beliefs?
- What about people with no religious/spiritual beliefs?

***Topic 2***

Next, we turn to mood disorders.

Student's will also be asked to consider:

- Can you think of some examples of biblical characters that apparently suffered from a mood disorder? Describe their behavior?
- What do their examples suggest about possible causes? (Hint: Elijah, David, Saul, others?)

!!! *Note: If a student is not familiar with biblical personages, they can give an example from literature or contemporary public life.*

***Topic 3***

Schizophrenia is our next topic of study.

Student's will also be asked to consider:

- Before the development of modern psychology, how do you think people suffering from schizophrenia were treated? How much better is treatment today?

***Topic 4***

Finally, we end this unit with Personality Disorders

In addition to an ungraded key terms quiz, Student's will also be asked to consider:

- Do you ever wonder if someone you know seems to have a personality disorder? What are some indications that you have seen that make you curious if there may be a problem? (If you donâ€™t know anyone personally, you can describe someone you know about or have seen in a movie/TV show.)
