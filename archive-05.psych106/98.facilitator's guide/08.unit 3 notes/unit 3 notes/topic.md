## Unit 3: The Developing Person - Part 1

This is the first part of a two part section of the course. In this first part, we look at important developmental considerations in the field of psychology....

***Topic 1***

This Topic begins looking at the idea of Designer babies. Please refer to this this topic (specifically). For this guiding question, it refers to a pamphlet found in the Learning Activities section of Topic 1 - students are then asked for their thoughts.

!! *Please bare in mind that some might consider this a controversial subject - remind students of the expectations for Learning Labs and that the focus is on open-mindedness and respectful dialogue.*

***Topic 2***

This Topic focuses on "children" as a developmental stage:

 - What is God like for children of different levels of cognitive development? If you can, give some examples from children you know....

 -  Would children even have an idea of God if they were not taught it?

***Topic 3***

Although this Topic discusses adolescence, student's are asked to reflect on that period of time in their own life:


 - Would you want to live your adolescence over again if you could? Why or why not?

!!! *Please remind student's that the next unit (Unit 4), also includes some major assignments - their first quiz and their first writing assignment. Please suggest that student's turn their attention to these assignments and begin thinking about preparing.*
