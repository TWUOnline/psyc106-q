## Facilitation Guide

# PSYCH 106: Introduction to Psychology II

## Welcome to PSYCH 106: Introduction to Psychology!

This course is organized into 12 units. Each page of the course will provide you with the following information:

* A general overview of the topic that will be addressed during the unit.
* Specific learning outcomes and topics for the unit.
* Resources that you will need to address learning activities and assessments in the unit.
* Learning activities that you will need to complete each week.
* Assessments pages will provide you with information about assignments that you will need to complete each week

Over the next _ weeks, you will be hosting Facilitated Learning Labs at a designated FAR Centre location. During lab times, as course facilitator, you will be guiding group discussions, answering any questions learners and faculty may have, helping learners understand the assignments, and evaluating their participation in labs as specified by the LDRS 220 Participation Rubric.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask. We are here to bring clarity, provide encouragement and supportive connection alongside you and the learners on this blended-learning journey.
