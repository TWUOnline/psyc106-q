Unit 6 & 7 are another two-part section from the textbook.

***Topic 1***

 - Describe a time when you were forced to act in a certain way, and then later found you had come to enjoy what you were doing. That is, your attitude followed your actions.
 - Could this happen with religious attitudes and beliefs too?

***Topic 2***

 - What pressures for conformity exist in your community? On your campus?***
 - What happens to people who do not conform?
 - Is conformity good or bad? What would society be like without conformity?

***Topic 3***

Consider the following scenario/prompt:

*When people read about Stanley Milgram's experiments on obedience to au­thor­ity, they are often puzzled at the ethics of this research. You have probably have heard of these studies before and already have some views about the ap­propriate­ness of the procedures. All psychologists follow ethical guidelines in their research established by national governing bodies (e.g., CPA, APA). At the heart of these state­ments about ethics are the responsibilities to: protect the subject's welfare, avoid deception, provide anonymity, and provide therapy or relief from any unin­tended results of the experiment. Each of these general principles applies to the Milgram studies. Do you believe that the studies could be conducted today, given what we know now about ethics and about Milgram's results?*

 - Does the severity of the problem studied—in this case destructive obedience—justify more extreme steps to manipulate and deceive experimental subjects?

 - Under what circumstances do you personally think that deceiving subjects in a scientific experiment might be ethically warranted or justified?

***Topic 4***

 - Have you ever been taught a sales technique in your job experience? If so, explain...

If you have not been taught a sales technique, you certainly have experienced many as a consumer. Can you give an example? Here is one:

*One of the standard ways that door-to-door salespersons will try to get you to buy something is the so-called foot-in-the-door technique: They will ask you to do them a small favor. Having done so, you will have to justify your own behavior to yourself by think­ing nice things about the seller. Hence, you are more likely to comply when they ask you to sign on the dotted line.*
