## Unit 5: Personality

In this unit, student's will begin to explore understanding *how we become who we are....* It is hoped, that the guiding questions in each Learning Lab are particularly interesting and lead to in-depth discussion as many of the questions ask student's to reflect on who they are.

***Topic 1***

 - Does God speak through dreams?
 - What reasons do you have for your opinion? Can you give an example?

---

***Topic 2***

 - If you wanted to study the psychologically healthiest individuals, whom would you study? How would you decide?

***Topic 3***

Part of this unit's Learning Lab will have student's take a personality test - it is hoped this stimulates some thought and reflection. In that context, student's are asked to respond to the following:

 - What is the role of heredity in personality?
 - Is our personality inherited and set for life? Can it be modified?

Author Tim LaHaye has taken the Greek idea of types and body humors and adapted it to a Christian perspective incorporating the concept of spiritual gifts.

 - Does the bible support an approach to personality that links individual differences to inherited traits?
 - What is the role of the Holy Spirit in relationship to traits? Are these different “gifts” (I Cor. 12)? Different “fruit (Gal 5:22)? Can they be changed?

***Topic 4***

Research indicates that an internal locus of control is associated with more positive psychological outcomes than an external locus of control:

 - Does this mean that Christians (and others who believe in God) are less psychologically healthy because they believe an external force (God) is in control?
