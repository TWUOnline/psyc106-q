title: 'Learning Labs - Ideas and Suggestions'
---


As mentioned in previous notes, the intent of Learning Labs is to focus on stimulating thought and dialogue. Much of the *"questions"* in this course are open to interpretation - there is no "right" answer. The study of psychology also requires some open-mindedness, compassion, and understanding of the complexities of our relationship with the world around us. Student's have much to learn from one another's thoughts and ideas and, ultimately, that is the hope and intention of our Learning Lab's and the questions that have been provided to guide thought and reflection.

These guiding questions have been left intentionally "open" as I want to encourage student's to explore these areas and, hopefully, stimulate some thought and excitement for the field of psychology. This, however, can be a challenging process if student's are reluctant to participate. Between your skill-set as a facilitator, and my experience as an instructor, it is my hope we can work together to create a positive, engaged atmosphere during Learning Labs to promote personal growth.

Below are some ideas - if you are comfortable, however, please feel free to incorporate your own ideas to encourage learning and growth:

1. [**1-2-4-ALL**](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/)

This activity helps to:

 - Engage every individual in searching for answers.
 - Avoid overhelping and the overcontrol-dependency vicious cycle.
 - Create safe spaces for expression, diminish power differentials.
 - Express “silent” conversations and expand diversity of inputs.
 - Enrich quality of observations and insights before expression.
 - Build naturally toward consensus or shared understanding.

2. [**Impromptu Networking**](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/2-impromptu-networking/)

This activity is good for:

 - Initiate participation immediately for everyone provided the questions are engaging.
 - Attract deeper engagement around challenges.
 - Invite stories to deepen as they are repeated.
 - Help shy people warm up.
 - Affirm individual contributions to solutions.
 - Emphasize the power of loose and new connections.
 - Suggest that little things can make a big difference.

3. [**User Experience Fishbowl**](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/18-users-experience-fishbowl/)

This activity helps:

 - Get down-to-earth field experience and all the questions and answers about new endeavors out on the table for everyone to understand at the same time.
 - Create conditions for new ideas to emerge.
 - Make space for every participant’s imagination and experience to show up.
 - Build skills in listening, storytelling, pattern-finding, questioning, and observing.
 - Celebrate early adopters and innovators who have gained field experience (often failing forward and vetting the prototype).

4. [**Drawing Together**](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/20-drawing-together/)

This activity helps to:

 - Reveal insight or understanding not accessible with verbal or linear methods.
 - Tap all the sources of knowledge for innovation (explicit, tacit, latent/emergent).
 - Signal that a quest or journey in search of new discoveries is under way.
 - Develop and deepen shared understanding of a vision or complex dynamics.
 - Create closer connections among group members.

!!! *Note: This is a good activity to consider if student's are particularly reluctant to engage in discussion*

! ***The following sections will outline the guiding questions for each unit in the course. As you read through, consider which activity(s) you might consider to facilitate conversation. If you are struggling, please contact the instructor for additional guidance.
