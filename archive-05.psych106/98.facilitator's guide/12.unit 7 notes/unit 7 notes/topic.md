## Unit 7: Social Psychology - Part 2

This unit is the second part that continues to build upon Unit 6.

***Topic 1***

 - Should violent content be removed from video games, movies, and TV (why or why not)?

***Topic 2***

 - What do you think contribute to you being able to quickly judge whether or not you think someone is attractive?

 - Some social psychologists believe that there is always a reward for helping and that this motivates people to help. In other words, people never help without expecting a reward of some kind (either in this life or in the next). What do you think?
