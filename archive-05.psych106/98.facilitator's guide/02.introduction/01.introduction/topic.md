In this section, we will outline some key ideas to consider as you facilitate this course. See below for advice on setting up your class schedule, facilitating activities and discussions, and guiding students through Learning Labs.

***NOTE:*** In the past, this course may be offered as part of various sections with various timelines for completion. Please contact the Instructor to identify the best schedule given the unique timeline for your section.

#### **Learning Labs**

Note that students will do part of their learning online, and part in a Learning Lab that you will be facilitating. This is a flipped classroom model where students engage with the content at home by reading the textbook, reading and viewing course materials on Moodle as designed by the instructor, and preparing activities and assignments for the next Learning Lab. In Learning Labs, they will engage in group discussions, assignments, and other activities in order to help them engage with the course material.

***Part 1 - Sample Welcome Message and Orientation to the Course:***

I am excited to be your facilitator for Psych 106. As the course begins, I wanted to take some time now, to walk through this course so you can develop a sense of what is ahead.

This course will be organized into 12 units. Each page of the course will provide you with the following information:

 - A general overview of the topic that will be addressed during the unit.
 - Specific learning outcomes and topics for the unit.
 - Resources that you will need to address learning activities and assessments in the unit.
 - Specific learning activities that you will need to complete each unit at home (before attending your Learning Lab).
 - Information about formal assessments throughout the course.

For those who are new to using Moodle as the platform for your course content and for submitting assignments, you can find information on how to navigate through this course on the tab provided [**HERE**](https://learn.twu.ca/course/view.php?id=7008&section=1).

Over the duration of the course, we will be meeting together for ___ hours per week. During our time together, I will be facilitating group discussions, answering questions, helping you with your assignments, and evaluating your participation in class using the rubric provided on each unit page.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask. I am here to help and be your guide on this journey through your Introduction to Psychology 106 course.

***Part 2: Introductions and ICE Breakers***

**NOTE:** *I included this as an option for Facilitators. Depending on the nature of the student’s, or your own personal preferences/experiences, please feel free to use or discard. I would, however, strongly recommend an “introductory activity” or some sort as much of the Learning Lab’s will involve discussion with one another. This is just one sample of what you could use:*

Before we get started today, lets all introduce ourselves and get to know each other. I would like everyone to share a little about who you are and why you are taking this course. If you already know most of your classmates, be sure to include some new information they might not all know about you such as:

 - General information about yourself as a person and a student.
 - What field you intend to “go into” when you graduate.
 - Your biggest question, doubt, or fear about the class.
 - How did you come to enroll in this course or program?
 - Do you have any experience with this topic?
 - What do you hope to gain from this class?

Student’s can then share this information with the class – either their own or have partners share about their partners.

!!! **NOTE:** Please remind students to keep language and “tone” professional and respectful. This might be a good opportunity to “frame” the expectations for the rest of Learning Lab discussions as some topics may be divisive or controversial – student’s need to be made aware that everyone needs to focus on respectful dialogue.

#### **General Expectations**

Prior to beginning each unit, it is strongly recommended that you take a moment to familiarize yourself with the content, and activities, student’s will be participating in. While your primary role will be in facilitating discussion during Learning Lab’s, you will also need to help “troubleshoot” any issues or general questions that arise throughout each unit. Specific notes for each unit will be provided in subsequent sections of this guide.  If any questions arise, please connect with the Instructor ASAP.

**General Overview**

As mentioned in the previous section, take some time, prior to each Learning Lab, to familiarize yourself with the content and guiding questions of that given unit. Learning Lab’s have, intentionally, been left “open” so that student’s can explore and pursue their interests in the content of each unit - It is not the intention to keep these labs as rigid structures! As you will see in each unit, guiding questions have been provided for student’s to ponder and “engage” with.

Please also direct students to the quizzes at the end of each unit. One of the Learning Outcomes in this course is for student’s to develop some familiarity with key terminology in the field of psychology – these quizzes are intended to support that. Also reiterate with the students that they are not part of a formal assessment – they are for practice to prepare for assignments and formal quizzes and tests. You will also see that some chapters from the textbook span two units in this course – as such, not every unit will have a quiz. Please make students aware of this.

#### **Learning Lab Activities**

As you will experience, different groups of student’s bring different opportunities and different challenges. If you develop the sense that  a particular group is willing and able to engage in group dialogue, it may be best to structure conversations so that everyone is contributing and responding to one another. It might also be helpful to structure smaller pairings so dialogue can take place in a more comfortable “intimate” setting before bringing all students together to share their thoughts and ideas.

In other settings, student’s may be more reluctant to engage in group dialogue. As such, your role will involve offering some latitude around what participation looks like. Following-up with prompts such as “why,” or “can you explain or give some examples” is encouraged, this does not always result in for fruitful dialogue. As you will see, the questions are quite “wide” in scope and ask student’s to call upon their own experiences and/or beliefs – due to this nature, some of the following might be options for student’s as well:

 - Drawing a picture
 - Designing a game
 - Creating a skit
 - Developing an app
 - Writing a poem (or song lyrics)
 - Listing words (in English or their first language) that are connected to the question(s).
 - Creating a math formula or using numbers to represent their thoughts.
 - Design an experiment to test their ideas.
 - Anything else that they might be comfortable with in demonstrating their thoughts.

As the facilitator, it is trusted that you will use your own experience, training, and best judgement with respect to which direction you take the Learning Lab’s in. If you are struggling, please always refer to the guiding principle here: it is intended that student’s engage with the course content in a meaningful way and be active participants in their own learning, as well as supporting the learning of their peers. While I understand that this flexibility, at times, can be overwhelming, please do not hesitate to connect with me so we can clarify and discuss.

Ultimately, student’s will be assessed on their openness and willingness to actively participate in a meaningful way – please remind them of this at the start of each Learning Lab as it might serve as a motivator moving forward....
