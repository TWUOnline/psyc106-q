***Topic 2***

This section focuses on problem-solving...in that context, student's are asked to respond to the following scenario/prompt:

In the largest sense, society is breaking into two classes:

*The first class are people who know how to think. These people realize that most problems are open to examination and creative solution. If a problem appears in the lives of these people, their intellectual training will quickly lead them to a solution or an alternative statement of the problem. These people are the source of the most important product in today's economy – ideas.*

*The second class, the vast majority of society, are people who cannot think for themselves. I call these people ‘idea consumers’ – metaphorically speaking, they wander around in a gigantic open-air mall of facts and ideas. The content of their experience is provided by television, the Internet and other shallow data pools. These people believe collecting images and facts makes them educated and competent, and all their experiences reinforce this belief. The central, organizing principle of this class is that ideas come from somewhere else, from magical persons, geniuses, ‘them.’*

Consider the following prompts to help better prepare for the discussion:

 - Do you agree or disagree with this claim?

 - Do you know people that fit in the second category? What causes this difference? How might it be changed?
