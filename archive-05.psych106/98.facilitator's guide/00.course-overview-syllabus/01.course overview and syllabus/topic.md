### Course Description

Introduction to Psychology, is intended as a broad introduction to the field of psychology. It may be seen as an answer to the questions "What is psychology?" and "What do psychologists do?" Topics considered include: thought and language, intelligence, lifespan development, personality, social processes, health, stress and coping, behavioral disorders, and therapy. Attempts will be made throughout to relate the content of psychology to students' everyday experience as well as to a Christian  worldview. Of course, to take this course it is not necessary that you be a Christian. Whatever your beliefs, you are encouraged to examine them in light of what you are learning.
