- The title page can be varied, so please follow the format that your professor  suggests.

---

### Step 3
# Content pages
##### Page 2 ~

---

[.autoscale: true]

1. Header: A header should be inserted only with the essay title, TITLE OF YOUR ESSAY (i.e. NO “Running head:”), lined up with the left-hand margin.
2. Pagination: A page number should appear on every page (including the title page) on the RIGHT side of the header. The header and page number should be a ½ inch from the top of the page.
3. The Title of Your Paper: The Title of Your Paper should appear on the second page of the essay centered at the top.
  - NOTE: The Title of Your Paper should be short and concise and inline in ONE line of the header.

---

4. Indentation: All new paragraphs should be indented a 1/2 inch (one tab space).
5. Margins: The margins should be “align text left” (not “justified”).
6. Spacing: The ENTIRE essay should be double-spaced only, including references (no extra space between paragraphs or references).

---

### For example  

- The Title of Your Essay is “Canadian Cultural Icon- Beaver”.
- Essay Type is “APA Essay”.
- Then, page 2 of your essay will look like below.

---

### Step 4
# References page
##### LAST page of your essay

---

- Regardless of the remaining space of your last content page, your reference list appears at the end of your essay on a SEPARATE sheet of paper with the title References (not bolded, underlined, or italicized) centered at the top of the paper.
  - Even if you have only ONE source to list, the section title should be “References”.

---

- References should be put in alphabetical order according to the LAST name of each author or the name of the publication.
- Indentation: All lines after the first line of each reference should be indented a 1/2 inch (one tab space) from the left margin. They should also be double spaced like the rest of the paper.
- Cross-referencing: ALL your citations in your essay should be matched with all the references recorded in the references page.
