# Thought and Language

## Overview {-}

***Welcome to Psych 106***

We begin this course by reviewing some important information on scientific research methodologies. While this review will be self-guided, it is critical that you understand the important elements that constitute valid and reliable scientific research as it is these methodologies that serve as the backbone for psychological studies.

After taking time to review scientific research methodologies, we will turn our attention to the subject of Thought and Language. Developing an understanding of Thought and Language helps us better understand how we think, how we organize our thoughts and our knowledge of the world around us, and how we communicate and act out on this information.

### Topics {-}

This unit is divided into the following topics:

 1. Review- Scientific Research  
 2. Thinking and Problem Solving  
 3. Cognitive Biases  
 4. Language and Thought  
 5. Animal Language  


### Learning Outcomes {-}

When you have completed this unit, you should be able to:

- Define key terminology related to principles of scientific research, research designs, and statistics.

## What is Psychology

We begin our course with a quick challenge: ***In your own words, define "psychology."***

According to your definition, how is psychology different from other academic areas that would study humans (*for example, philosophy, literature, or history*)? If you said "Pyschology is different because it uses the scientific method"- give yourself a pat on the back

You will begin your study of the scientific method by reading your textbook. The parable below (*from Philipchalk's Social Psychology textbook*), however, helps illustrate the scientific method with three "helpful" approaches to a problem, including a simple experiment:

*Once upon a time there were three brothers. One day while they were working in their father's field, they saw an old man coming along the road. The old man greeted them, and then struggled on along the road, limping terribly. After that, every day at the same time, the brothers greeted the old man and watched as he hobbled by. When a month had passed, they were so impressed that they each did something. The first brother wrote a compelling story about perseverance in the face of the ravages of old age. It encouraged many people. The second brother painted a moving portrait of the old man, stooped over and limping along. People were inspired. The third brother, who had observed the old man very closely, asked him one day if he could exchange shoes with him. The old man was surprised, but he gladly agreed. When the old man walked away he did not limp. The next day the third brother gave the old man his shoes back and watched as he limped on his way. On the third day, the brother again exchanged shoes with the old man. Then he took the old man's shoes to a shoemaker and had them repaired. When the brother gave them back to the old man he was delighted. The old man put on the shoes, thanked the brother, and walked away without a limp.*

Although each brother made a positive contribution, the third brother solved the man's problem because he discovered its cause. To do this, ***he used the scientific method and he conducted an experiment (Philipchalk, 1994).***

I think psychology is one of the most interesting areas of study there is, first, because it studies people, people like you and me, and we’re interesting Second, I like psychology because it is so broad. Psychologists, as you will soon see, study everything from nerve conduction in single cells, all the way to the influence of groups on our behaviour—and everything in between. Finally, psychologists don’t just speculate and theorize, they look for evidence for their ideas. If they don’t find sufficient evidence, they change their ideas; and I like that. Which leads us back to the scientific method and how psychology began.

## Thinking and Problem Solving

### Thinking {-}

“So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.” (Genesis 1:27)

“I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.” (Psalm 139:14)

The human image of God means many things. It seems that one aspect of this image is our thinking ability, including our ability to solve problems and speak. How important is our thinking ability in our reflection of God’s image? What does your answer mean for people with less ability? What about people who lose abilities due to accident or disease (e.g., Alzheimer’s patients)?

### Algorithms & Heuristics {-}

Algorithms and heuristics can be confusing. An algorithm is a guaranteed route to a solution, but it may be the long way around to success. If you knew a person lived somewhere in a large residence hall, an algorithm for finding that individual would be to knock on every door until you located the person. Heuristics, on the other hand, sug­gest that you would first ask friends where to locate the person, or check a list, then knock on the appropriate door to locate the person. Another way to think of heuristics is the phrase "rule of thumb." Can you think of some rules of thumb that you have learned from your various job experiences? They may have to do with how long to cook a hamburger, or when to refill a machine, or how to get a date.

Consider the following example and explanation taken from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ron Philipchalk:


<!-- [plugin:content-inject](../_1-1)-->

*In the second part of the book, they tell you how to crack a safe. There are all kinds of ninny-pinny, dopey things, like "It might be a good idea to try a date for the combination, because lots of people like to use dates." Or "Think of the psychology of the owner of the safe, and what he might use for the combination." And "The secretary is often worried that she might forget the combination of the safe, so she might write it down in one of the following places—along the edge of her desk drawer, on a list of names and addresses . . ." and so on . . . .*

*I also did a certain amount of systematic study. For instance, a typical combination was 69-32-21. How far off could a number be when you're opening the safe? If the number was 69, would 68 work? Would 67 work? On the particular locks we had, the answer was yes for both, but 66 wouldn't work. You could be off by two in either direction. That meant you only had to try one out of five numbers, so you could try zero, five, ten, fifteen, and so on. With twenty such numbers on a wheel of 100, that was 8000 possibilities instead of the 1,000,000 you would get if you had to try every single number. . . .*

*I practiced all the time on my own safe so I could do this process as fast as I could and not get lost in my mind as to which number I was pushing and mess up the first number. Like a guy who practices sleight of hand, I got it down to an absolute rhythm so I could try the 400 possible back numbers in less than half an hour. That meant I could open a safe in a maximum of eight hours—with an average time of four hours. (Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman, p. 140)*

Mr. Feynman's safecracking system succeeds because he methodically works through every possible combination. By logical analysis he has discovered which 8,000 possibilities out of 1,000,000 he needs to try. We call this type of logical step-by-step procedure for solving problems an algorithm (Newell & Simon, 1972; Simon, 1981). If you use the correct algorithm your success is guaranteed.

But sometimes it can take a long time to discover the correct algorithm. And employing an algorithm is often time consuming. Mr. Feynman spent days developing his system and it took hours to open a safe. You could certainly open a safe much faster if you found the combination on the edge of the secretary's drawer.

The shortcuts Mr. Feynman calls "ninny-pinny, dopey things" are examples of heuristics. Heuristics are rule-of-thumb strategies for solving problems, shortcuts we develop from our experience. Heuristics often help us eliminate improbable alternatives and guide us to the most likely solution to a problem. Despite his appreciation for algorithms, Mr. Feynman discovered heuristics can be useful. He found, for example, that safe owners often did not bother to change the factory set combination when they received a new safe. In one office building the temporary factory combinations 25-0-25 or 50-25-50 opened one safe in five

Algorithms and heuristics are examples of cognitive strategies—mental plans we use to make decisions and solve problems.

### Activity: Problem Solving Activities {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

In this lesson, we spent time exploring cognitive strategies used to solve problems and make decisions. We now have an opportunity to practice this on our own Take a look at the following problems and see if you can find a solution. As you work through the problems, think about what cognitive strategies you are implementing as you make each decision:

### Activity: Questions for Consideration {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Read the following and consider the questions below:
In the largest sense, society is breaking into two classes:
  
*The first class are people who know how to think. These people realize that most problems are open to examination and creative solution. If a problem appears in the lives of these people, their intellectual training will quickly lead them to a solution or an alternative statement of the problem. These people are the source of the most important product in today's economy-ideas.*

*The second class, the vast majority of society, are people who cannot think for themselves. I call these people ‘idea consumers’ – metaphorically speaking, they wander around in a gigantic open-air mall of facts and ideas. The content of their experience is provided by television, the Internet and other shallow data pools. These people believe collecting images and facts makes them educated and competent, and all their experiences reinforce this belief. The central, organizing principle of this class is that ideas come from somewhere else, from magical persons, geniuses, ‘them.’*

- ***Do you agree or disagree with this claim?***
- ***Do you know people that fit in the second category? What causes this difference? How might it be changed?***

*Be prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class*

```

## Cognitive Biases

As if the biases mentioned in the textbook are not enough, here are a few more to watch out for, taken from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ron Philipchalk.

### The Gambler's Fallacy {-}

Jill and Bob are the parents of three boys. Jill is pregnant again, and she and Bob are hoping the baby is a girl. In fact, they are confident the baby must be a girl because their previous three children were boys. If you agree with Jill and Bob that the baby is more likely to be a girl than a boy, then you—along with Jill and Bob—may be committing the gambler's fallacy. No matter how many boys have been born, the likelihood of a girl being born is the same as it always was, approximately 50 % (assuming no biological abnormality or medical intervention).

The gambler's fallacy arises from our failure to recognize the independence of unconnected events. The result of a coin toss does not depend on the outcome of previous tosses; a child's sex at conception is not affected by the sex of prior conceptions; the cards dealt in a hand are not influenced by the distribution of cards on the previous deal; and so on. Each event in these sequences is independent of the others, although we tend to think that somehow there must be a connection.

### The Anchoring and Adjustment Heuristic {-}

First impressions of a person exert a powerful influence on the way we interpret subsequent information about that person. This effect may be an example of a more general principle called the anchoring and adjustment heuristic. Information we use to establish a starting value (or anchor point) tends to be more influential in our decisions than subsequent information we use to adjust this value (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).

Daniel Cervone and his colleagues found, for example, that initial success or failure on a task can establish an anchor for feelings of self-efficacy. Students who initially succeed on a task and later fail have higher feelings of self-efficacy than students who initially fail and later succeed even though their overall level of success is the same. Final judgments of self-efficacy are biased in the direction of initial judgments (Cervone & Palmer, 1990; Peake & Cervone, 1989).

Salespeople often use the anchoring and adjustment heuristic to their advantage. Some real estate agents routinely show their clients an over-priced and unattractive house first in order to set an anchor point which, in effect, says, "The kind of house you want is going to cost a lot." Once established, this expectation of high price changes very slowly and the clients are relieved to find an acceptable house in their price range (Northcraft & Neale, 1987).

Car dealers too like us to set our sights high. Their so-called list price establishes an anchor or reference point that overshadows our subsequent evaluations, as I recently discovered. In looking for a certain model of car, I was attracted to a particular vehicle with an asking price of $3,800 ("reduced from $4,200"). I believed this price was too high, so I bargained with the vendor. Eventually, I bought the car for $2,800. Did the high original asking price affect my decision? Yes, it probably did. Subsequent events indicated I still paid too much. I later bought an identical model in only slightly poorer condition for $2,000. I was a victim of the anchoring and adjustment heuristic.

***Contrast Effects***

My car purchase also illustrates a related distortion in judgment, the contrast effect. In contrast to the original price of $4,200 my offer of $2,800 seemed like a bargain. John Lynch, Jr. and his colleagues (1991) found a similar effect with students. The students rated low-priced cars as less expensive when they were considered alongside high-priced cars (contrast effect), compared to when they were considered along with other low-priced cars (no contrast).

Research by Douglass Kenrick and his colleagues indicates that we also show contrast effects in evaluating other people. In one study (1980), male college students rated the attractiveness of potential blind dates. Subjects who gave their ratings after watching a TV show with attractive female actresses rated the potential dates as less attractive than did subjects who rated their potential dates before watching the show. In another study (1989), after viewing centerfold erotica, men found average women—and even their own wives—less attractive.

### Heuristics & Biases {-}

By now you may be wondering why we fall prey to so many cognitive biases and errors. Well don’t worry; our biases are actually a side effect of our cognitive efficiency. Most of our biases result from using heuristics, rules of thumb, or mental shortcuts that work very well. Sometimes they let us down, but overall, they improve the speed with which we handle mental problems—much like Mr. Feynman’s safe-cracking tricks. As we noted in the previous discussion, you could certainly open a safe much faster if you found the combination on the edge of the secretary's drawer. However, you won’t always find the combination there, so limiting yourself to this approach would produce a kind of “cognitive bias” in your safe-cracking strategy.

## Language and Thought

### Linguistic Relativity {-}

Benjamin Whorf’s linguistic relativity hypothesis suggests that our language affects the way we see the world. Do you know any examples of weather terms, for example, that are unique to one area? Could knowing these terms help you to notice differences in weather that outsiders might not notice? What about in sports? Sports fans usually know terms to de­scribe certain strokes or plays. Does knowledge of these terms affect percep­tion? Can you think of some examples? What does it mean to “clothesline” someone, or “post-up,” or “birdie?”

### Imaginary Practice {-}

Mental practice is now widely accepted in many areas. The following excerpt is taken from the [**GolfPsych**](https://www.golfpsych.com){target="_blank”} website. You may find further examples there as well.

"You can practice the mental aspects of your game anytime. We encourage our clients to do imagery practice of playing well in upcoming tournaments. This imaginary practice includes seeing the course, situation, doing a full mental pre-shot routine and seeing a good shot. You should also be feeling the way you do when you play your best. In addition, you should be practicing deep breathing and quieting your mind off-course. This is an extremely valuable tool that must be practiced to be effective. The mental game is much more than thinking positive thoughts. Take our Personality Assessment and get your own GolfPsych Report to receive our recommendations for you based on your personality and our research. Reading our book will also help you understand all aspects of a good mental game. During your practices and before your rounds you should also be practicing your mental skills."

### Activity: Question for Consideration {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

The subject of our focus for this section has been on the power of language in influencing how we see the world. In this activity, you are asked to focus on the importance of language in the Bible (and other religious writings) and how it "shapes" how we see the world.

Carefully consider the following question:

- ***Give some examples of the importance of language in the Bible or other religious writings.***

*Be prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class*

## Animal Language

### Language {-}

As a Christian I am pleased to see in psychology the resurgence of interest in studying some of what Ronald Koteskey (1980) calls humanity's "God-like" characteristics, creativity, imagery, and particularly language.

The use of words is extremely important in Christian scripture. God spoke the creation into existence; Jesus is called the Word; the significance of Babel and Pentecost are closely linked to the importance of language; and there is great power associated with an individual's name. In addition, Christians have usually considered the ability to communicate with words to be part of the image of God in man. However, recently several researchers claim to have taught animals, usually chimpanzees or apes, to communicate through language. Using sign language, blocks, or keyboards and computer- generated voices, the animals have signaled their needs and even generated word combinations.

But is this truly language? There is no doubt that the animals are using symbols as signs to stand for objects and actions. However, there are significant questions being raised about the comparison with human language.

Christians need to think carefully about what they mean when they talk about the image of God in man. The area of human learning and psycholinguistics offers some intriguing questions for thoughtful Christians. What is the origin of human speech-is it learned (as Skinner would say) or largely innate (as Chomsky would say)? Is human speech unique? Do the studies of language in animals necessitate a redefinition of the uniqueness of man? (Based on Psychology and Christianity by Ron Philipchalk, p. 102)
