This is the course book for {[}insert{]}. This book is divided into 6 units of study to help you engage with the materials. The course resources and learning activities are designed not only to help prepare you for the course assessments, but also to give you opportinities to practice various skills.

Below you will find information about how to navigate this book. Please also refer the schedule in Moodle, as well as the Asseessment section in Moodle for instructions on required readings and assignments.

\hypertarget{course-notes}{%

You should be reading this information in the context of a Trinity Western University course offered via Moodle. If this is not the case, then this may be an unauthorized reproduction of the course. Please contact \href{mailto:elearning@twu.ca}{\nolinkurl{elearning@twu.ca}} if you have concerns.

These notes will be your guide through the learning activities and assessment strategies necessary for you to succeed in the course, so it is important for you to engage to the best of your ability and take advantage of the resources available to you through Trinity Western University.

Assessment tasks are managed in other sections of the Moodle course, so be sure to familiarize yourself with those requirements and resources.

\hypertarget{how-this-course-is-built}{%
\section*{How this Course is Built}\label{how-this-course-is-built}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{How this Course is Built}

This course is primarily designed to be completed asynchronously, meaning that there are no scheduled times or places that you are required to meet, even online. You can work according to your own schedule \emph{within the six weeks you have to complete the course}. That said, this is a full university level course and there are timelines that we strongly recommend that you meet to ensure that you are succeeding in building your knowledge through the course.

It would be to your significant disadvantage to submit everything at the end of the course.

Asynchronous courses require learners to be well-organized and self-motivated, and we have included supports for you to help you develop strong learning habits that will ensure your success.

For example, there are several self-check quizzes throughout the course. These quizzes are not graded, but they can be powerful tools for you to ensure you understand key ideas and concepts. We suggest you take each quiz without the aid of your notes and textbook and multiple times until you have mastered the content. This strategy taps into three powerful learning structures that have been shown to be highly effective.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Effortful recall.} By intentionally trying to recall information without external aids, you are strengthening the neural pathways in your brain that lead to building new connections between ideas. One way to make recall easier is to connect key ideas to other things that you know or have experienced. For example, you might be studying World War II, and you connect the date that Canadians participated in the D-Day operation with something else meaningful to you that happened on June 6, like maybe the date you bought your first car.
\item
  \textbf{Spaced repetition.} By spreading out your attempts on the quiz (leaving a few days between attempts) you can maximize the effects of the first strategy (effortful recall) and ensure that your second or third attempts truly reflect what you know about the topic. We suggest leaving 1-3 days between attempt 1 and 2, then 4-5 days between attempt 2 and 3. You can use a tool like Trello, Notion, or Asana (free versions), or even a task list on your phone to set up a spaced repetition schedule.
\item
  \textbf{Interleaving.} This is the practice of studying a particular topic for a relatively short period of time (maybe 30-40 mins), then switching to a different topic for the same period, before going back to the original topic. We will help build this into your learning by including items from unit 1 in your unit 2-6 quizzes. You can also practice this by taking regular breaks in your work, or even by retaking a unit 1 quiz while you are working in unit 2.
\end{enumerate}

These three strategies are very effective at helping people \emph{remember} key facts about a particular topic, an important first step in learning at the university level. However, you will be asked to do much more than just remember facts. Your ultimate goal is to develop \textbf{evaluative judgement}, or the ability for you to judge for yourself the quality of your (or your peers') responses to prompts.

The discussion forums are a key way for you to do this. We have set up the forums in such a way that you will need to present a response to any given prompt before you see other learners' responses. We strongly encourage you to use this structure to formulate your own ideas before you present them in the forum, and then to use the responses of your peers to help you evaluate your own response.

Using these self-check activities in this way is designed to help you to succeed on the course assignments, upon which your final grade will be determined. These assignments will require you to \textbf{use} the facts of the course to generate unique responses to the prompts, based on your past experiences, knowledge, and ability to evaluate the quality of your own work.

\textbf{\emph{Welcome to Psych 106}}

We begin this course by reviewing some important information on scientific research methodologies. While this review will be self-guided, it is critical that you understand the important elements that constitute valid and reliable scientific research as it is these methodologies that serve as the backbone for psychological studies.

After taking time to review scientific research methodologies, we will turn our attention to the subject of Thought and Language. Developing an understanding of Thought and Language helps us better understand how we think, how we organize our thoughts and our knowledge of the world around us, and how we communicate and act out on this information.

\hypertarget{what-is-psychology}{%
\section{What is Psychology}\label{what-is-psychology}}

We begin our course with a quick challenge: \textbf{\emph{In your own words, define ``psychology.''}}

According to your definition, how is psychology different from other academic areas that would study humans (\emph{for example, philosophy, literature, or history})? If you said ``Pyschology is different because it uses the scientific method''- give yourself a pat on the back

You will begin your study of the scientific method by reading your textbook. The parable below (\emph{from Philipchalk's Social Psychology textbook}), however, helps illustrate the scientific method with three ``helpful'' approaches to a problem, including a simple experiment:

\emph{Once upon a time there were three brothers. One day while they were working in their father's field, they saw an old man coming along the road. The old man greeted them, and then struggled on along the road, limping terribly. After that, every day at the same time, the brothers greeted the old man and watched as he hobbled by. When a month had passed, they were so impressed that they each did something. The first brother wrote a compelling story about perseverance in the face of the ravages of old age. It encouraged many people. The second brother painted a moving portrait of the old man, stooped over and limping along. People were inspired. The third brother, who had observed the old man very closely, asked him one day if he could exchange shoes with him. The old man was surprised, but he gladly agreed. When the old man walked away he did not limp. The next day the third brother gave the old man his shoes back and watched as he limped on his way. On the third day, the brother again exchanged shoes with the old man. Then he took the old man's shoes to a shoemaker and had them repaired. When the brother gave them back to the old man he was delighted. The old man put on the shoes, thanked the brother, and walked away without a limp.}

Although each brother made a positive contribution, the third brother solved the man's problem because he discovered its cause. To do this, \textbf{\emph{he used the scientific method and he conducted an experiment (Philipchalk, 1994).}}

I think psychology is one of the most interesting areas of study there is, first, because it studies people, people like you and me, and we're interesting Second, I like psychology because it is so broad. Psychologists, as you will soon see, study everything from nerve conduction in single cells, all the way to the influence of groups on our behaviour---and everything in between. Finally, psychologists don't just speculate and theorize, they look for evidence for their ideas. If they don't find sufficient evidence, they change their ideas; and I like that. Which leads us back to the scientific method and how psychology began.

``So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.'' (Genesis 1:27)

The human image of God means many things. It seems that one aspect of this image is our thinking ability, including our ability to solve problems and speak. How important is our thinking ability in our reflection of God's image? What does your answer mean for people with less ability? What about people who lose abilities due to accident or disease (e.g., Alzheimer's patients)?

\hypertarget{algorithms-heuristics}{%
\subsection*{Algorithms \& Heuristics}\label{algorithms-heuristics}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Algorithms \& Heuristics}

Algorithms and heuristics can be confusing. An algorithm is a guaranteed route to a solution, but it may be the long way around to success. If you knew a person lived somewhere in a large residence hall, an algorithm for finding that individual would be to knock on every door until you located the person. Heuristics, on the other hand, sug­gest that you would first ask friends where to locate the person, or check a list, then knock on the appropriate door to locate the person. Another way to think of heuristics is the phrase ``rule of thumb.'' Can you think of some rules of thumb that you have learned from your various job experiences? They may have to do with how long to cook a hamburger, or when to refill a machine, or how to get a date.

Consider the following example and explanation taken from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ron Philipchalk:

\emph{In the second part of the book, they tell you how to crack a safe. There are all kinds of ninny-pinny, dopey things, like ``It might be a good idea to try a date for the combination, because lots of people like to use dates.'' Or ``Think of the psychology of the owner of the safe, and what he might use for the combination.'' And ``The secretary is often worried that she might forget the combination of the safe, so she might write it down in one of the following places---along the edge of her desk drawer, on a list of names and addresses . . .'' and so on . . . .}

\emph{I also did a certain amount of systematic study. For instance, a typical combination was 69-32-21. How far off could a number be when you're opening the safe? If the number was 69, would 68 work? Would 67 work? On the particular locks we had, the answer was yes for both, but 66 wouldn't work. You could be off by two in either direction. That meant you only had to try one out of five numbers, so you could try zero, five, ten, fifteen, and so on. With twenty such numbers on a wheel of 100, that was 8000 possibilities instead of the 1,000,000 you would get if you had to try every single number. . . .}

\emph{I practiced all the time on my own safe so I could do this process as fast as I could and not get lost in my mind as to which number I was pushing and mess up the first number. Like a guy who practices sleight of hand, I got it down to an absolute rhythm so I could try the 400 possible back numbers in less than half an hour. That meant I could open a safe in a maximum of eight hours---with an average time of four hours. (Surely You're Joking Mr.~Feynman, p.~140)}

Mr.~Feynman's safecracking system succeeds because he methodically works through every possible combination. By logical analysis he has discovered which 8,000 possibilities out of 1,000,000 he needs to try. We call this type of logical step-by-step procedure for solving problems an algorithm (Newell \& Simon, 1972; Simon, 1981). If you use the correct algorithm your success is guaranteed.

But sometimes it can take a long time to discover the correct algorithm. And employing an algorithm is often time consuming. Mr.~Feynman spent days developing his system and it took hours to open a safe. You could certainly open a safe much faster if you found the combination on the edge of the secretary's drawer.

The shortcuts Mr.~Feynman calls ``ninny-pinny, dopey things'' are examples of heuristics. Heuristics are rule-of-thumb strategies for solving problems, shortcuts we develop from our experience. Heuristics often help us eliminate improbable alternatives and guide us to the most likely solution to a problem. Despite his appreciation for algorithms, Mr.~Feynman discovered heuristics can be useful. He found, for example, that safe owners often did not bother to change the factory set combination when they received a new safe. In one office building the temporary factory combinations 25-0-25 or 50-25-50 opened one safe in five

Algorithms and heuristics are examples of cognitive strategies---mental plans we use to make decisions and solve problems.

While all of these pages may not relate directly to this unit's discussion, consistent reading will help you keep pace, as well as provide necessary background knowledge when you need it.

\textbf{Problem Solving Activity}

In this lesson, we spent time exploring cognitive strategies used to solve problems and make decisions. We now have an opportunity to practice this on our own Take a look at the following problems and see if you can find a solution. As you work through the problems, think about what cognitive strategies you are implementing as you make each decision:

\textbf{\emph{Problem A}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Take a look at the following Roman Numeral: \textbf{IX}
\item
  Now add one line to the Roman numeral \textbf{IX} to make it six
\end{itemize}

Click here for the solution.

The answer is to add a curved line shaped like an ``S'' (i.e., ``SIX''). In writing, the problem looks simple, but you might want to try it aloud on a friend. There is a mental set that one must add a straight line and have some form of Roman numeral on the page.

\textbf{\emph{Problem B}}

Your task is to plant trees on Arbor Day. You have ten trees that must be planted in five rows of four trees each. How would you plant the trees?

Click here for the solution.

The answer is that you would arrange them at the vertices and cross-points of a 5-pointed star

\textbf{Problem Solving Practice}

Below is a website that provides more opportunity to work through, and solve, some problems. Specifically, this resource explores the idea of \textbf{\emph{Assumptions}} and the role assumptions play when solving problems. Furthermore, this is a valuable resource as it also explores other important techniques to be implemented when solving problems.

Your Learning Lab for this unit will focus on group discussion as explore the topics of this unit in more detail. As you prepare for your Learning Lab, one possible scenario that discussion will focus on is below- please prepare some thoughts to share with the group:

In the largest sense, society is breaking into two classes:

\emph{The first class are people who know how to think. These people realize that most problems are open to examination and creative solution. If a problem appears in the lives of these people, their intellectual training will quickly lead them to a solution or an alternative statement of the problem. These people are the source of the most important product in today's economy -- ideas.}

\emph{The second class, the vast majority of society, are people who cannot think for themselves. I call these people `idea consumers' -- metaphorically speaking, they wander around in a gigantic open-air mall of facts and ideas. The content of their experience is provided by television, the Internet and other shallow data pools. These people believe collecting images and facts makes them educated and competent, and all their experiences reinforce this belief. The central, organizing principle of this class is that ideas come from somewhere else, from magical persons, geniuses, `them.'}

Consider the following prompts to help better prepare for the discussion:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Do you agree or disagree with this claim?}}\\
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Do you know people that fit in the second category? What causes this difference? How might it be changed?}}

\hypertarget{cognitive-biases}{%
\section{Cognitive Biases}\label{cognitive-biases}}

As if the biases mentioned in the textbook are not enough, here are a few more to watch out for, taken from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ron Philipchalk.

\hypertarget{the-gamblers-fallacy}{%
\subsection*{The Gambler's Fallacy}\label{the-gamblers-fallacy}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{The Gambler's Fallacy}

Jill and Bob are the parents of three boys. Jill is pregnant again, and she and Bob are hoping the baby is a girl. In fact, they are confident the baby must be a girl because their previous three children were boys. If you agree with Jill and Bob that the baby is more likely to be a girl than a boy, then you---along with Jill and Bob---may be committing the gambler's fallacy. No matter how many boys have been born, the likelihood of a girl being born is the same as it always was, approximately 50 \% (assuming no biological abnormality or medical intervention).

The gambler's fallacy arises from our failure to recognize the independence of unconnected events. The result of a coin toss does not depend on the outcome of previous tosses; a child's sex at conception is not affected by the sex of prior conceptions; the cards dealt in a hand are not influenced by the distribution of cards on the previous deal; and so on. Each event in these sequences is independent of the others, although we tend to think that somehow there must be a connection.

\hypertarget{the-anchoring-and-adjustment-heuristic}{%
\subsection*{The Anchoring and Adjustment Heuristic}\label{the-anchoring-and-adjustment-heuristic}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{The Anchoring and Adjustment Heuristic}

First impressions of a person exert a powerful influence on the way we interpret subsequent information about that person. This effect may be an example of a more general principle called the anchoring and adjustment heuristic. Information we use to establish a starting value (or anchor point) tends to be more influential in our decisions than subsequent information we use to adjust this value (Tversky \& Kahneman, 1974).

Daniel Cervone and his colleagues found, for example, that initial success or failure on a task can establish an anchor for feelings of self-efficacy. Students who initially succeed on a task and later fail have higher feelings of self-efficacy than students who initially fail and later succeed even though their overall level of success is the same. Final judgments of self-efficacy are biased in the direction of initial judgments (Cervone \& Palmer, 1990; Peake \& Cervone, 1989).

Salespeople often use the anchoring and adjustment heuristic to their advantage. Some real estate agents routinely show their clients an over-priced and unattractive house first in order to set an anchor point which, in effect, says, ``The kind of house you want is going to cost a lot.'' Once established, this expectation of high price changes very slowly and the clients are relieved to find an acceptable house in their price range (Northcraft \& Neale, 1987).

Car dealers too like us to set our sights high. Their so-called list price establishes an anchor or reference point that overshadows our subsequent evaluations, as I recently discovered. In looking for a certain model of car, I was attracted to a particular vehicle with an asking price of \$3,800 (``reduced from \$4,200''). I believed this price was too high, so I bargained with the vendor. Eventually, I bought the car for \$2,800. Did the high original asking price affect my decision? Yes, it probably did. Subsequent events indicated I still paid too much. I later bought an identical model in only slightly poorer condition for \$2,000. I was a victim of the anchoring and adjustment heuristic.

\textbf{\emph{Contrast Effects}}

My car purchase also illustrates a related distortion in judgment, the contrast effect. In contrast to the original price of \$4,200 my offer of \$2,800 seemed like a bargain. John Lynch, Jr.~and his colleagues (1991) found a similar effect with students. The students rated low-priced cars as less expensive when they were considered alongside high-priced cars (contrast effect), compared to when they were considered along with other low-priced cars (no contrast).

Research by Douglass Kenrick and his colleagues indicates that we also show contrast effects in evaluating other people. In one study (1980), male college students rated the attractiveness of potential blind dates. Subjects who gave their ratings after watching a TV show with attractive female actresses rated the potential dates as less attractive than did subjects who rated their potential dates before watching the show. In another study (1989), after viewing centerfold erotica, men found average women---and even their own wives---less attractive.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Heuristics \& Biases}

By now you may be wondering why we fall prey to so many cognitive biases and errors. Well don't worry; our biases are actually a side effect of our cognitive efficiency. Most of our biases result from using heuristics, rules of thumb, or mental shortcuts that work very well. Sometimes they let us down, but overall, they improve the speed with which we handle mental problems---much like Mr.~Feynman's safe-cracking tricks. As we noted in the previous discussion, you could certainly open a safe much faster if you found the combination on the edge of the secretary's drawer. However, you won't always find the combination there, so limiting yourself to this approach would produce a kind of ``cognitive bias'' in your safe-cracking strategy.

Could knowing these terms help you to notice differences in weather that outsiders might not notice? What about in sports? Sports fans usually know terms to de­scribe certain strokes or plays. Does knowledge of these terms affect percep­tion? Can you think of some examples? What does it mean to ``clothesline'' someone, or ``post-up,'' or ``birdie?''

``You can practice the mental aspects of your game anytime. We encourage our clients to do imagery practice of playing well in upcoming tournaments. This imaginary practice includes seeing the course, situation, doing a full mental pre-shot routine and seeing a good shot. You should also be feeling the way you do when you play your best. In addition, you should be practicing deep breathing and quieting your mind off-course. This is an extremely valuable tool that must be practiced to be effective. The mental game is much more than thinking positive thoughts. Take our Personality Assessment and get your own GolfPsych Report to receive our recommendations for you based on your personality and our research. Reading our book will also help you understand all aspects of a good mental game. During your practices and before your rounds you should also be practicing your mental skills.''

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Language}

As a Christian I am pleased to see in psychology the resurgence of interest in studying some of what Ronald Koteskey (1980) calls humanity's ``God-like'' characteristics, creativity, imagery, and particularly language.

The use of words is extremely important in Christian scripture. God spoke the creation into existence; Jesus is called the Word; the significance of Babel and Pentecost are closely linked to the importance of language; and there is great power associated with an individual's name. In addition, Christians have usually considered the ability to communicate with words to be part of the image of God in man. However, recently several researchers claim to have taught animals, usually chimpanzees or apes, to communicate through language. Using sign language, blocks, or keyboards and computer- generated voices, the animals have signaled their needs and even generated word combinations.

But is this truly language? There is no doubt that the animals are using symbols as signs to stand for objects and actions. However, there are significant questions being raised about the comparison with human language.

Christians need to think carefully about what they mean when they talk about the image of God in man. The area of human learning and psycholinguistics offers some intriguing questions for thoughtful Christians. What is the origin of human speech-is it learned (as Skinner would say) or largely innate (as Chomsky would say)? Is human speech unique? Do the studies of language in animals necessitate a redefinition of the uniqueness of man? (Based on Psychology and Christianity by Ron Philipchalk, p.~102)

As David Myers points out, intelligence is a slippery concept. We all have an idea of what it refers to, but we cannot agree on a single definition. Perhaps the most helpful advice is to remember, as Myers points out, that ``intelligence is a socially constructed concept. Cultures deem `intelligent' whatever attributes enable success in those cultures'' (2010). Historically, in North American culture, the idea of intelligence performance on an IQ test. The composition of these tests reflected North American culture's emphasis on particular mental abilities, specifically, those associated with success in an academic setting. More recently, we have come to realize that there are many kinds of intelligence. In this unit we will consider some varieties of intelligence, or multiple intelligences.

\textbf{\emph{Emotional Intelligence}}

I have to admit that when I first heard of emotional intelligence (EI) I was skeptical. It sounded like popular psychology - someone trying to make a buck preying on our need for self-knowledge. However, upon further investigation I found that EI was linked to social intelligence (the ability to understand and relate to people), a concept developed by the pioneering psychologist E.L. Thorndike in 1920. And upon still further investigation, I found EI made a lot of sense.

\section{Sternberg's Three Components of Intelligence}\label{sternbergs-three-components-of-intelligence}}

Robert Sternberg wanted to show that intelligence was more than just one general ability (known as \emph{g theory}). He believed our intelligence is best classified into three areas that predict real - world success: \textbf{\emph{analytical, creative, and practical.}} The following article does a great job explaining the Triarchic Theory of Intelligence and its three sub-theories. It also makes note of the criticisms that have been brought against this theory. \emph{To better understand Sternberg's Three Components of Intelligence follow the link below:}

In this unit we investigated Intelligence Testing. One of the important concepts we learned was that Intelligence Testing can be controversial due to its socially constructed nature.

Below is a link to a website that will allow you to take some Intelligence Tests for yourself. As you work through each test, and see the results, think about why we might consider these types of tests beneficial, and why they might be considered controversial.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{IQ Testing}

In this section we continue to build upon our understanding of intelligence and testing to focus on Intelligence tests and those who score at the ``extremes.'' Intelligence tests are the most common tool used to measure intelligence. Intelligence test are one method of assessing an individual's mental aptitudes and comparing them with those of others using numerical scores. These scores are then plotted on a normal (bell) curve to estimate where a person's intelligence rates in relation to a standardized population. The extremes of intelligence is the understanding that on one end of the continuum are those with intellectual disabilities and on the other end are those who are geniuses.

The value in doing this is not that you will get an accurate idea of your IQ score, but rather that you might get a better understanding for some of the problems in testing. As you try some of the tests at the following sites, remind yourself of the problems of test standardization, validity, and reliability. How well do you think these tests measure up?

As we prepare for our Learning Lab this week, we consider intelligence from a Christian perspective. Read the following passage and carefully consider the questions below to help prepare for our discussion:

\emph{The Bible says, in James; Chapter 2:}

\emph{My brothers, as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, don't show favoritism. Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in. If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, ``Here's a good seat for you,'' but say to the poor man, ``You stand there'' or ``Sit on the floor by my feet,'' have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Could we be guilty of favoritism in esteeming more intelligent people above less intelligent people? In society? In Church?}}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{nature-nature-and-iq}{%
\section{Nature-Nature and IQ}\label{nature-nature-and-iq}}

While the debate rages over the relative contributions of nature and nurture to IQ, no one denies that heredity (nature) plays some role. The question arises then, ``So what?'' Are we going to try to control (and presumably increase) IQ through genetic engineering or some other method of eugenics (\emph{Eugenics is the search for hereditary factors that give people an evolutionary advantage; translated it can mean ``good genes'' or ``good origin''})? Are we going to control who should have children and how many, allowing the most intelligent parents to have more children and restricting the less intelligent? When the genetic basis for IQ (or some other component of intelligence) is identified, will parents select embryos with greater potential? For more on this topic see the following quote and the website from which it came.

``If we are concerned for the future of the (hopefully) millions of generations still to be born, we must realize that their fate lies to a considerable extent in the breeding practices of those who are currently alive.'' \emph{(Intelligence and Eugenics)}

\hypertarget{what-will-you-do}{%
\section{What Will You Do?}\label{what-will-you-do}}

If or when you have children, will you ban screens (TV, smart phone, tablet, laptop) as a ``brain rotter'' and read to them every day? Or will you just let nature take its course and allow both screens and reading?

\hypertarget{test-biases}{%
\section{Test Biases?}\label{test-biases}}

IQ tests are generally valid for their original purpose---as predictors of aca­demic performance. Controversy arises when IQ scores are taken to mean over­all intelligence and even overall worth. IQ scores consistently predict that some cultural and racial groups will do better at school than will other groups. These differ­ences are an indication of bias not in the IQ tests but in the back­grounds and academic settings that first create and then magnify differences.

While there is no ``formal'' assignment that you will be responsible for submitting for Unit 2, you will be expected to participate in discussion during your Learning Lab. Your facilitator will be providing a participation mark based on your contributions. Below is some information to consider prior to attending your Learning Lab:

\emph{Active participation in group exercises, reflection, and critical discourse is an essential component of this course. You are expected to show respect for all members of the course, both in your speech and actions. Contribute by actively observing and listening, raising thoughtful questions, examining relevant issues, building on others' ideas, analyzing and evaluating the group's thinking, synthesizing key points, and expanding the group's perspectives. Take care not to dominate a conversation, giving space for others to speak. When in small groups help maintain the focus, flow, and quality of conversations, and take the initiative to invite others (particularly those who are quiet) to speak.}

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Designer Babies}

It is beginning to look inevitable that, however fierce the debate, the technology to make designer babies will happen - maybe just 20 years from now. Geneticists claim to have found the gene for good-parenting, genes for obesity, Alzheimer's, red hair, and even happiness. Incredibly, scientists have even constructed an artificial human chromosome, which could carry any genes a geneticist - or prospective parents - desired.

Embryo A technique called Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) is already being used to screen embryos for genetic diseases. Embryos created outside the body using in vitro fertilization are tested to see whether they carry a genetic disorder before being transferred to the uterus. It's deeply controversial whether parents should ever be allowed to select embryos just because they're genetically different.

At the moment the technique is used for therapeutic purposes only, to screen for children who may have a deadly genetic disease. Even if some parents and their doctors were willing to use PGD for cosmetic or enhancement purposes, which remains absolutely taboo, the technique is limited in a crucial way - PGD can only select an embryo with genes inherited from the parents.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{A Child's View of God}

One evening on a camping trip several years ago, my wife and I listened outside the tent as our five-year-old Joelle and three-year-old Matthew tried to get to sleep. Always the ``mother,'' Joelle attempted to dispel her little brother's fear of bears and other wild creatures by reminding him that Jesus was watching over them. Not content with generalities, Matt responded, ``Does Jesus got a gun?'' \emph{(Psychology and Christianity by Ronald Philipchalk, p.~141)}

As any Sunday School teacher knows, children see God differently from adults---often in very concrete terms (protection requires a gun!). Studying cognitive development can help us to understand as well as teach children at their own level.

\hypertarget{the-process-of-cognitive-change}{%
\subsection*{The Process of Cognitive Change}\label{the-process-of-cognitive-change}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{The Process of Cognitive Change}

Our textbook provides a good summary of the structure (stages) of cognitive development. The section, however, does not address the process by which a person moves from one stage to the next. Piaget believed that the key to cognitive development is something called cognitive conflict or cognitive disequilibrium. For cognitive development to proceed, the individual must constantly re-evaluate his or her schemas. According to Piaget, we develop schemas from an early age of life. Schemas are our cognitive representations of the world. Schemas help us to organize our experiences. They also allow us to make predictions about what outcomes might result from particular behaviours. Schemas are very important in helping us to understand and to adapt to the world.

Although schemas are important in helping us to understand the world, they are not always accurate. People at all ages can have mental representations of the world that are not correct.

\textbf{\emph{Can you think of any examples of inaccurate schemas?}}

Although people at all ages can have inaccurate mental representations of the world, children are especially prone to view the world in an incorrect way. The reason children may view the world in an incorrect way is because the structure of their cognitive processing is developing. Piaget believed that inaccurate schemas are changed only when they are challenged in the cognitive structure of the child. This challenge has been termed cognitive conflict.

Basically, the process of cognitive change works as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  People are motivated to maintain a state of cognitive equilibrium.\\
\item
  When a child encounters information from the world and the information is inconsistent with his or her schema, the new piece of information creates a state of disequilibrium or cognitive conflict.\\
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Equilibrium}} may be restored through one of the two processes of adapation called assimilation and accommodation.\\
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Assimilation}} occurs when a child re-organizes the new information in such a way as to make the new piece of information consistent with his or her preexisting schema of the world.\\
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Accommodation}} occurs when a child alters his or her schema such that the new piece of information can now be incorporated into the new schema.
\end{itemize}

Thus the process of accommodation produces the greatest cognitive change. Can you think of examples of both assimilation and accommodation? Here is an example:

\textbf{Equilibrium-Preexisting Schema:} Child has grown up in an environment where all people he interacted with were of the same race (mom, dad, siblings, grandma, grandpa, etc.) Child has seen people of other racial groups, but has never interacted with them. Child develops the schema that people tend to like others who are of the same race as him or her.

\textbf{Cognitive Conflict Produced:} At four years of age the child begins to attend preschool. At this time he starts to interact with children of various races. The child begins to develop a friendship with a child of a different race. This friendship creates cognitive conflict for the child: ``How can I like someone who is a different color?'' To resolve this cognitive conflict, the child has two options:

\textbf{\emph{Option A}}- \textbf{Assimilation:} In order to maintain his or her preexisting schema, the child re-organizes the information such that the other child is not perceived to be so dissimilar after all: ``Maybe he is a different color from me, but we both speak English. We must not be so dissimilar after all.''

\textbf{\emph{Option B}}- \textbf{Accommodation:} The child's preexisting schema is altered such that the new information can be incorporated into a new way of perceiving the world, ``Maybe I can be friends with someone who is different from me.''

\hypertarget{cognitive-equilibrium-is-restored}{%
\subsection*{Cognitive Equilibrium is Restored}\label{cognitive-equilibrium-is-restored}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Cognitive Equilibrium is Restored}

Although cognitive equilibrium is restored via either assimilation or accommodation, assimilation serves to maintain an inaccurate schema (that differences inhibit the development of friendships) whereas accommodation serves to produce cognitive change and hence produces a more accurate representation of the world (that differences do not inhibit the development of friendships).

\section{Adolescence}\label{adolescence}}

John has just turned 13. Over the past year he has experienced may changes. He has grown over six inches and he has developed acne over his face and back. Not only is he changing physically, he is also experiencing a wave of emotional, spiritual, cognitive, and sexual changes. John has become self-focused and very self-critical. In addition, he is beginning to think abstractly and to challenge adults' ``dominion'' on knowledge. John is also on a quest to understand ``who he is'' and ``what his place is in the world''. John's quest for an identity makes him more vulnerable to peer pressure and to the influence of radical groups and cults. During this time that we call adolescence, John will make many decisions that will have a profound effect on the direction his life will take.

\emph{Does any of the above sound familiar?}

Before you begin reading the textbook section on adolescence, think back to your own adolescence. As you think about your experience of adolescence, use the following questions to guide your reflection:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What physical changes did you experience in adolescence?
\item
  How did these physical changes make you feel?
\item
  In what ways did your view of the world change during adolescence?
\item
  How did your way of treating other people change during adolescence?
\item
  What was most important to you during adolescence?
\item
  To what extent is ``who you are today'' a function of ``who you became during adolescence''?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{no-adolescence}{%

In other times and in other cultures to­day, adolescence does not exist as a significant and distinct period of develop­ment. This might seem surprising and difficult to imagine. Think of how modern society would be different, or if it could even exist, without a period of adolescence. What are the advantages and disadvantages of having an adolescent period?

\hypertarget{identity}{%

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Identity}

The concept of identity is a rich topic for consideration. The most familiar aspect of identity is occupational identity, since much of ``who we are'' in our society rests on the kind of work we do. Perhaps you can readily relate to this in your choice of major. Less familiar, but equally important, is ideological identity. Ideologi­cal identity, including both religious and political orientations, may un­dergo a tremen­dous upheaval during your student years. Do you have the same political beliefs as your parents? What about religious beliefs? Conflict and questioning of parental beliefs and values may be a necessary part of establishing your personal iden­tity---even if the beliefs and values you ultimately adopt are the same as those of your parents.

\hypertarget{psychosocial-development}{%
\subsection*{Psychosocial Development}\label{psychosocial-development}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Psychosocial Development}

There are many changes we experience during the time we call adulthood. According to Erikson's theory of psychosocial development, adults move through three important stages during which they must resolve important psychosocial conflicts:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Early Adulthood\\
\item
  Middle Adulthood\\
\item
  Late Adulthood
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\emph{In Early Adulthood}} (20-40 years of age) the psychosocial crisis is one of intimacy versus isolation. Although it is often perceived as critical whether or not the person develops an intimate relationship with a lifelong partner, Erikson believed that although this is one component of intimacy in this stage, other types of intimacy are also important---like developing intimate relationships with workmates, colleagues, and even one's children. If one fails to develop a sense of intimacy during this stage, he or she will feel isolation.

\textbf{\emph{In Middle Adulthood}} (40-65 years of age) the psychosocial crises is one of generativity versus stagnation. What is generativity? Erikson used the term gererativity to describe the process by which a person feels like he or she is making a lasting contribution in the world. Usually, generativity involves giving something back to the next generation. People at this stage can feel generative in many ways---coaching a softball team, being a scout leader, teaching children in Sunday School, been a big brother/sister, etc. If a person fails to develop a sense of generativity during this stage, he or she will feel a sense of stagnation.

\textbf{\emph{In Late Adulthood}} (65+ years of age) the psychosocial crisis is one of ego integrity versus despair. If the individual looks back on his or her life and feels a sense of pride in the accomplishments he or she has made, then the individual will feel a sense of ego integrity. However, if the person looks back on his or her life and does not see the significance of his or her accomplishments, then he or she will feel a sense of despair at the meaninglessness of his or her life.

\hypertarget{guilt}{%
\subsection*{Guilt}\label{guilt}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Guilt}

One of the most significant developments in childhood, from both a secular and Christian point of view, is a conscience with its attendant guilt. Is guilt simply a conditioned emotional response (as the behaviorist might say)? Is it the result of conflict with the superego (as a psychoanalyst would say)? Is it the failure to live up to our self-concept (as the humanist might say)? Is it the voice of the Holy Spirit? Or is it some combination of these? (For help on this issue and an important distinction between false and true guilt see Counts and Narramore (1970), Narramore (1984), Tournier (1962).) \emph{(from Psychology and Christianity, by Ronald Philipchalk, p.~146)}

The textbook discusses moral development in childhood and adolescence. However, many adults are troubled by questions of right and wrong, and in particular, by feelings of guilt. The Christian authors noted above suggest that many guilt feelings are not true guilt but false guilt carried over from childhood experiences. Understanding how conscience and guilt feelings develop can help to liberate us from unnecessary false guilt inappropriately attributed to God.

\subsection*{Death}\label{death}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Death}

Secular psychologists see death as final. Christians, however, see resurrection beyond, with death being but another step in that direction. What implications do these beliefs have for the process of dying?

As medical technology has advanced death has become more and more difficult to define. We need to focus our attention less on preserving the physical and more on preserving the personhood of the individual. This means giving greater attention to our concept of the dying person created in the image of God (as the abortion issue has forced us to do at the other end of life). When is personhood sacrificed to technical efficiency? Should we advocate a more ``natural death?'' What is ``natural death?'' How far does one go in ``allowing'' natural death? \emph{(from Psychology and Christianity, by Ronald Philipchalk, p.~146)}

\hypertarget{hospice}{%

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Hospice}

You matter because of who you are. You matter to the last moment of your life, and we will do all we can not only to help you die peacefully, but also to live until you die.'' \emph{(Dame Cicely Saunders)}

During the Crusades of the Middle Ages a hospice provided lodging for travelers: a place of refuge and comfort. So in 1967, when Dame Cicley Saunders opened a facility in London to provide care and comfort to dying people and their families, St.~Christopher's hospice was an appropriate name. \emph{(Courtesy of the Langley Hospice Society)}

\section{Writing Assignment \#1}\label{writing-assignment-1}}

Your first assignment for the course will involve reading a formal research article and extracting important information. Research articles play an important role in psychology as they present new findings and research that help us better understand the subject field. It is, however, important for us to understand what information is important as we weigh the value of the article we are reading. This assignment attempts to help us better understand those considerations.

Your first task is to read \href{assets/unit_4/Assessment_Empirical_Short.pdf}{\textbf{How to Read Empirical Articles}}

As you can see, it is important to understand \textbf{\emph{why}} you are reading an article and it is important to understand \textbf{\emph{what}} you want to get out of it.

Next, your task is to read \href{assets/unit_4/Assessment_Empirical_Long.pdf}{\textbf{How to Read a Journal Article in Social Psychology}}

\begin{itemize}

In Unit 5 of the course, our attention will focus on personality. The study of personality attempts to answer the questions: \emph{Who are you?} and, \emph{How did you become who you are?} As human's are astoundingly complex, there is not any one theory that can capture, in totality, a description of who you are; hence, there are numerous approaches and theories that attempt to address these questions. In this unit, you will learn about some of the contemporary approaches to the study of Personality, and examine and review cultural, biological, Psychodynamic and Humanistic approaches to Personality.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Personality Theories}

In this chapter we consider the topic of personality theories. In doing this we examine several major perspectives. Within each of these there are many variations (e.g., Adler, Jung, and Freud within the psychoanalytic perspective). If you would like to know more about this area, you might be interested in taking the course ``Theories of Personality'' \emph{(Psychology 301 at TWU).}

Aside from all these more formal theories, each of us has an implicit personality theory. This is our personal idea of what people are like, including which personality characteristics go together. For example, we think of people who are attractive and intelligent as likable rather than unlikable. Our socialization leads us to assume certain traits go together. As you go through this chapter, you may find some approaches are closer to your own assumptions (implicit theory), and you may prefer these approaches to others. You may also find your implicit theory becomes more explicit. Finally, you may even modify your own theory in the face of new information.

``And afterward, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions'' \emph{(Joel 2:28)}.

God apparently spoke through dreams many times in the bible, and in Joel 2:28 He promised to do so in the future. Does God still (or again) speak through dreams? Are we missing out on a possible leading from God when we ignore our dreams? If you would like to read more on this subject you might be interested in books by Christians on this subject. For example, see John A. Sanford's Dreams, God's Forgotten Language, or Morton T. Kelsey's God, Dreams, and Revelation, or Abraham Schmitt's Before I Wake. The website below (cf.~Online Resources) contains some balanced advice. Also, voice your opinion or give your experience in the online discussion.

\hypertarget{birth-order}{%
\subsection*{Birth Order}\label{birth-order}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Birth Order}

You may be familiar with Adler's concept of the family constellation, which implies that position in the family has a powerful effect on goals, self-concept, and ways of relating to others.

As a test of this concept, think of a three-child family, all of whom were born within a few years (using larger families makes things too complicated). Try applying Adler's theory to predict which child in the family is likely to be:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the best student\\
\item
  the most shy\\
\item
  the most helpful around the house\\
\item
  the most outgoing\\
\item
  the ``hell raiser''\\
\item
  the most ``helpless''\\
\item
  the charmer\\
\item
  the ``baby'' of the family
\end{itemize}

You will not always be right---but neither was Adler. The important thing is to note that Adler made psychology aware of the different expectations and social influences on different children in the same family. In some respects, children in the same position in different families are more alike than are children in differ­ent positions in the same family

In 1890, William James gave a simple formula for self-esteem:

\includegraphics{assets/unit_5/Unit5_Topic2_Image.png}

\emph{James explained:}

Such a fraction may be increased as well by diminishing the denominator as by increasing the numerator. To give up pretensions is as blessed a relief as to get them gratified; and where disappointment is incessant and the struggle unending, this is what men will always do. . . . How pleasant is the day we give up striving to be young---or slenderThank Godwe say, those illusions are gone. \emph{(James, 1890) (Quoted from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ron Philipchalk)}

In his textbook, David Myers discusses the pros and cons of promoting self-esteem. Consider also the following:

\hypertarget{self-esteem-a-contrary-view}{%
\subsection*{Self-Esteem: A Contrary View}\label{self-esteem-a-contrary-view}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Self-Esteem: A Contrary View}

Self-esteem is a popular topic in North American society and researchers have expended a vast amount of effort studying it. Approximately 10,000 studies have explored the possible relationship between self-esteem and various human problems (Scheff et al., 1989). The assumption that low self-esteem is at the root of many personal and social problems has reached the level of a cultural truism. The California legislature (1990) has even established a task force to promote self-esteem, believing that enhanced self-esteem is a vaccine against drug abuse, teen-age pregnancy, welfare dependency, and other social ills. Sharon Neuman (1992) suggests that the need to enhance self-esteem has become a ``motherhood issue''---meaning that belief in its value is so widely accepted it goes unquestioned.

Recently, however, several authors have begun to challenge this focus on raising self-esteem. They point out that high self-esteem can sometimes be detrimental, if, for example, it leads people to set inappropriate, risky goals that are beyond their capabilities (Baumeister, et al., 1993a). In addition, the relationship between self-esteem and other measures of well-being is often weak or nonexistent (Burr \& Christensen, 1992; Hermans, 1992; Jackson, 1984). Perhaps most importantly, high self-esteem may be the result and not the cause of other positive tendencies (Alexander \& Baker, 1992).

Sharon Neuman (1992) argues that self-esteem must follow, not precede, real achievement. She claims that no number of self-esteem programs can replace the genuine satisfaction of a job well done. Wesley Burr and Clark Christensen (1992) suggest that the idea that we must esteem ourselves highly before we can value and love others is a ``Western myth.'' They add:

We would improve our thinking if we were to take the idea that ``we cannot love others until we love ourself'' and turn it 180 degrees to be: ``We cannot love ourself until we love others.'' We would further improve our thinking if we then concluded that this is a fairly irrelevant and unimportant idea anyway because it still implies that loving ourself is what is important. (p.~464)

Burr and Christensen suggest that self-esteem is a fruit and not a root of healthy emotional connections between people. \emph{(From Invitation to Social Psychology by Ron Philipchalk)}

\hypertarget{christianity-humanism}{%
\section{Christianity \& Humanism}\label{christianity-humanism}}

Some Christians object to the humanistic perspective because of its unqualified affirmation of human goodness and its apparent promotion of self-love. It is important to note, however, that humanistic psychology is not to be equated with the philosophy and social movement called humanism. Although it focuses on humans, so too do other approaches to personality. (The behavioral psychologist B.F. Skinner was a signatory to the Humanist Manifesto but a major opponent of humanistic psychology.) In his authoritative work on the history of psychology, Ernest Hilgard writes, ``Humanistic psychology as something contemporary is not to be confused with other forms of humanism, such as humanistic studies which refer to classical or liberal arts topics, or that form of humanism which sets itself against theological beliefs (1987, p.~504). In fact, J.I. Packer and Thomas Howard in their book Christianity: The true humanism (1985) argue that only Christianity gives a valid basis for assuming humans have value.

\hypertarget{trait-theory}{%

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Trait Theory}

In the previous lesson we discussed implicit theories of personality. Many people's implicit theories include elements of trait theory. They believe that personality is made up of traits. For example, popular ideas of leadership and success often rest on this assumption (e.g., Traits for success).

Actually this view is quite old, going back to the ancient Greeks:

Almost 2,000 years ago a Greek physician named Galen suggested that there were four basic types of personality, based on four different ``humors,'' or fluids, in the body. Galen called these personality types sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, and melancholic. When Eysenck combined his two basic personality scales, he found that he had a ``less humorous'' version of a classic theory. \emph{(from Understanding Human Behavior by Ron Philipchalk \& James McConnell)}

In psychology today there is a growing effort towards accurate measurement of personality traits, and investigation of the ways in which traits interact with the environment.

One of the most popular applications of trait theory is in the prediction of employee success. After looking at the ``Big 5,'' which trait do you think is the most important? Imagine you own a business and you have to make a quick decision to hire one of 5 very similar applicants. The only trait measure you have is each applicant's score on the ``Big 5.'' The only problem is that each one scores high on a different factor. Which one would you hire?

\hypertarget{measuring-personality}{%
\subsection*{Measuring Personality}\label{measuring-personality}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Measuring Personality}

The trait approach to personality is closely linked to the matter of psychological testing. The strength of this approach is that it provides quantifiable data for analysis and comparison. The weakness is the difficulty in measuring traits accurately. Remember our discussion of \emph{standardization, validity,} and \emph{reliability} of intelligence tests? Personality tests must also meet the same criteria. (An additional problem is that our situations guide us as well as our traits.) This is an important point to remember when you encounter the many so-called personality tests in the popular media.

\hypertarget{barnum-effect}{%
\subsection*{Barnum Effect}\label{barnum-effect}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Barnum Effect}

Do you have a desire to know what ``kind'' of person you are? This common desire can be used to manipulate you in a variety of ways. As discussed in the textbook, sometimes it is easier to make people believe that you are measuring their personality than it is to actually measure it. In fact, it is remarkably easy for people to be convinced that a personality profile describes them well. This phenomena is known as ``the Barnum effect,'' after the circus showman P. T. Barnum. The Barnum effect hearkens back to the late 1940s, when psychologist Bertram Forer gave research participants a personality test and then generated a personality description that subjects believed was based on their test responses. Even though all participants were given exactly the same personality description, they found the profile to be highly convincing and descriptive of them as an individual. When asked to rate how well the profile described them, on a scale ranging from 0 (very poor) to 5 (excellent), the average rating was an impressive 4.26 (Forer, 1949)You, too, can try this experiment. Read the personality description below and rate, on a scale ranging from 0 (very poor) to 5 (excellent), how well this description describes you:

\emph{You have a strong need for other people to like you and for them to ad­mire you. You have a tendency to be critical of yourself. You have a great deal of unused energy which you have not turned to your advantage. While you have personality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them. Your sexual adjustment has presented some problems for you. Dis­ci­plined and controlled on the outside, you tend to be worrisome and in­se­cure inside. At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing. You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed-in by restrictions and limitations. You pride yourself as being an independent thinker and do not accept other opinions without satisfactory proof. You have found it un­wise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others. At times you are extro­verted, affable, sociable, while at other times you are introverted, wary, and reserved. Some of your aspirations tend to be pretty unrealistic.}

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{You + Your Environment}

Social-Cognitive Theory (SCT) was originally formulated by Albert Bandura at Stanford University. The fundamental premise of SCT is that models serve as the basis for learning new behaviours and that learning occurs in a social context with a dynamic and reciprocal interaction of the person, environment, and behavior; this is known as reciprocal determinism. Its emphasis is on external and internal social reinforcement and how these factors shape and maintain behavior in different environments. The theory also recognizes the influence of a person's past experiences, which factor into whether behavioral action will occur. These past experiences serve as the primary reinforcements and expectancies, shaping whether or not a person will engage in a specific behavior and answering why a person engages in that behaviour.

In summary, the Social-Cognitive view recognizes the mutual interdependence (``reciprocal determinism'') of individual qualities and situations. While we do have individual patterns of behaviour, we exhibit these according to the way we perceive our situation.

Your facilitator will be providing a participation mark based on your contributions for this unit. Below is some information to consider prior to attending your Learning Lab:

\emph{Active participation in group exercises, reflection, and critical discourse is an essential component of this course. You are expected to show respect for all members of the course, both in your speech and actions. Contribute by actively observing and listening, raising thoughtful questions, examining relevant issues, building on others' ideas, analyzing and evaluating the group's thinking, synthesizing key points, and expanding the group's perspectives. Take care not to dominate a conversation, giving space for others to speak. When in small groups help maintain the focus, flow, and quality of conversations, and take the initiative to invite others (particularly those who are quiet) to speak.}

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Overview}

No single factor has more impact on shaping the quality and direction of your life over virtually every aspect of your existence than relationships. In a way, everyone is a social psychologist. People constantly form ideas/opinions about why a person or a group of people are acting the way they are. Social psychology is similar to what people find themselves naturally doing except it uses scientific tools to study these hypotheses (the ideas/opinions). Social psychologist are primarily interested in examining the different ways that individual's effect groups of people and the way groups of people effect individual's. In this unit you will be introduced to some historical studies and main concepts in this field. Topics covered in this chapter include social influences on behaviour, social impressions and judgements, the relationship between attitudes and behaviour, and effective communication. Unit 6 (Part 1) looks at attributes and actions, conformity, obedience, and compliance. Unit 7 (Part 2) examines prejudice and aggression, and, though not specifically covered in the textbook, yet important to social psychology, attraction and altruism.

\textsuperscript{6} And this is love: that we \emph{walk} in obedience to his commands. As you have heard from the beginning, his command is that you \emph{walk} in love.\\
Walk -- Gr.\(\pi\epsilon\rho\iota\pi\alpha\tau\epsilon\omega\) (peripateō) -- to tread about, walk about, and generally, to walk, to be walking; *to make one's way, make progress;

to frequent\emph{, stay in, a place;

\item
  This activity is an opportunity to examine attribution theory and cognitive dissonance. Put simply, attribution theory asserts that people explain other people's behaviour by looking at either their personal dispositions or their situation. Which lens you use to view people through powerfully shapes your thoughts and actions towards them. Next, cognitive dissonance involves mental discomfort when your attitudes and actions are not in alignments. The article on cognitive dissonance shares are three factors that influence the level of dissonance a person may feel.\\
\item
  Social influence is everywhere; hence, it is important to recognize when you are being influenced by propaganda, brainwashing, or other manipulative messages. The first article in this activity allows you to interact with some facts and uses of social influence, which can increase your ability to recognize when these techniques are being used on, or by, you. The second article looks more in-depth than your textbook at the concepts of conformity and obedience and lays out different examples of each of these topics.\\
\item
  This Activity focuses on conformity, compliance, and obedience, and a consideration of ethical principles. Doing research that involves the use of deception is a highly debated issue within psychology. The articles in this activity will help you to become more knowledgeable about Stanley Milgram and research that looks at obedience. There is also a resource that discusses what the ethics psychologists must follow along with a decision-making process when facing an ethical dilemma article. \emph{Do not feel compelled to read every article extensively (though, they are all interesting), a review of the material should be sufficient to answer the Learning Lab questions.}\\
\item
  In this activity you will gain further knowledge about strategies that are employed to promote compliance. The first article draws attention to the myriad ways social media is, for the good and for the bad, shaping culture today. The second article describes the difference between what constitutes mind control versus social conditioning. This information is certain to be eye-opening.

\subsection*{The Ultimate Attribution Error}\label{the-ultimate-attribution-error}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{The Ultimate Attribution Error}

If you study attribution further, perhaps in a ``Social Psychology'' course, you find that there are several errors in attribution common to our perceptions of behavior. The ultimate attribution error is a combination of biases that influences our interpretation of behavior in our friends and our foes. The ultimate attribution error is our tendency to use internal attributions to explain socially desirable actions by members of our own group and socially undesirable actions by members of an opposing group. The same bias leads us to use external attributions to explain socially undesirable actions of our own group and socially desirable actions of our foes (Hewstone, 1988; Pettigrew, 1979, 1980 ; Taylor and Jaggi, 1974 ).

A study by Donald Taylor and V. Jaggi (1974) illustrates this bias among south Indian subjects. Taylor and Jaggi found that Hindu subjects attributed socially desirable actions to the good character of Hindus, but attributed the same actions in Muslims to environmental circumstances. In addition, Hindu subjects blamed socially undesirable actions on Hindus' circumstances and Muslims' character. We commit the ultimate attribution error when we say, ``Our soldiers fight because they have to'' (external attribution), but ``Our enemies fight because they are warlike'' (internal attribution). cf galleys And, ``Our soldiers are naturally brave''; ``Our enemies are forced to do daring deeds.''

The ultimate attribution error tends to perpetuate our false stereotypes and prejudices. Our biased interpretations have a plausible ring because the reasons for our enemies' actions are usually somewhat ambiguous and open to various interpretations. In addition, our friends fall into the same error and support our views. Consequently, we continue to see behavior the way we expect or would like it to be, and people we don't like never get a chance to prove us wrong. \emph{(from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ronald Philipchalk)}

``You can't legislate morality'' is a commonsense chestnut that social psycholo­gists have found not to be true. Attitudes do follow behavior. Eliot Aronson makes a persuasive argument that racial prejudiced attitudes and behaviors in the have actually responded dramatically and positively to civil rights legisla­tion and to court actions in the last several decades. In addition, he discusses sev­eral other methods that have been successfully used to reduce prejudice and discrimination, including his ``jigsaw'' technique, designed for use with grade school children. \emph{Aronson, E.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{http://healthyinfluence.com/wordpress/steves-primer-of-practical-persuasion-3-0/thinking/attribution/}{\textbf{Attribution Theory}}\\
\item
  \href{https://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-dissonance.html}{\textbf{Cognitive Dissnonance}}
\end{itemize}

These articles bring to light phenomena that tend to occur automatically (without conscious processing) for most people. Now that the concepts of attribution and cognitive dissonance are in your awareness it could be valuable to thoughtfully consider which attribution style you tend towards (dispositional or situational) and how that style influences how you treat others and how others respond to you. And, then ask, what am I doing with my cognitive dissonance? Do I tend to change my attitudes to fit my behaviours or do I adjust my behaviours to be alignment with my attitudes, values, and beliefs?

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Conformity, vs.~Compliance \& Obedience}

In this lesson, and the next two, we will be looking at social influence. Because this is a large and interesting topic we will discuss three types of social influence separately, conformity, compliance, and obedience. Conformity, our topic for today, refers to going along with other people without anyone explicitly asking you to. Compliance refers to going along with the request of another person when you have a choice not to. Being influenced by a salesperson to buy something is an example of compliance. Obedience refers to going along with an order when no choice is offered, as in the army.

\hypertarget{norms}{%
\subsection*{Norms}\label{norms}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Norms}

Group expectations or norms exert a powerful influence on our behavior. We generally go along with what people expect of us not because we have to but because resistance is so uncomfortable. You can experience the power of group norms in controlling your behavior if you attempt to violate a norm for acceptable behavior (e.g., go the front of a line and edge in; ask someone for their seat on a bus or subway; sit close to a stranger in a public place when other seats are available).

\hypertarget{using-conformity}{%
\subsection*{Using Conformity}\label{using-conformity}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Using Conformity}

At the lowest level of social influence people are observed to go along with what other people are doing, often without being asked. Adults are frequently critical of adolescents for conforming to erratic youthful fashions, while they are often just as bound to their own conservative guidelines (why else would anyone where a necktie?). Conformity is a common and usually harmless part of everyday life; yet it can lead to complacent and even erroneous judgments. In a classic study of conformity approximately one-third of the subjects gave what they knew to be the wrong answer when four other ``subjects'' (actually confederates of the experimenter) gave the same wrong answer (Asch, 1952, 1955). Although frequently innocuous, conformity can be harmful when it is inappropriate.

Are Christians abusing the power of conformity when they pre- arrange for volunteers to ``go forward'' at an altar call in order to increase the number of non-Christians who will respond? Or are they merely being sensitive to the pressures that the non-Christian feels to conform to those who remain in their seats? Should Christians use this technique of influence? \emph{(from Psychology and Christianity by Ronald Philipchalk, p212)}

\hypertarget{conformity-culture}{%
\subsection*{Conformity \& Culture}\label{conformity-culture}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Conformity \& Culture}

Researcher Gary Lee and his associates found significant differences among 122 cultures in the emphasis given to conformity. Conformity differences de­velop as a result of socialization of children into parental values. Parents in cul­tures emphasizing conformity relied more heavily on physical punishment than parents in cultures emphasizing self-reliance.

The ``Mach Test'' is a twenty-item inventory designed to reveal Machiavellian tenden­cies, a manipulative kind of social skill. Based on Machiavelli's writings, the in­stru­ment purports to identify people who, under social pressure, are able to retain their composure, while others are losing control. You can get an idea of your mach score, and thus presumably your tendency to use and be influenced by social influence, at:

\emph{Due to the pervasiveness of social influence, it cannot be overstated how important it is to understand the concepts and techniques associated with it. The purpose of these resources is to allow you to grow in your ability to be persuasive and to recognize when tools of influence are being used on you. It will also allow you to be more mindful of what/who you are conforming to and why it is that you are doing so. If you are really adventurous you may even want to take this knowledge to help you or someone else adopt a new attitude, belief, or action.}

\item
  \textbf{\emph{What happens to people who do not conform?}}\\

  \textbf{\emph{Is conformity good or bad? What would society be like without conformity?}}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{obedience}{%
\section{Obedience}\label{obedience}}

Obedience refers to the strongest level of social influence, the level at which an order is given and no choice is assumed. For example, we are expected to obey the law; we are not assumed to have a choice.

The study of obedience has proven somewhat unsettling for those with an optimistic view of human nature. Under orders, people have been willing to \textbf{(a)} subdue a helpless protesting individual with electric shock labeled extremely dangerous (Milgram, 1963); \textbf{(b)} administer a drug to a patient at double the recommended dosage, when the drug had not been approved by the hospital and when, contrary to regulations, the orders were given by an unfamiliar physician over the phone (Hofling et al., 1966), \textbf{(c)} place cute puppies in a restraining harness and give them strong electric shock (Sheridan and King, 1972). However, rather than uncovering a sadistic or evil type of individual these studies indicate that in the momentum of the situation, and under legitimate authority, people will perform acts which they would otherwise find abhorrent.

The ominous parallel with so-called ``war crimes'' is clear. Soldiers from many countries and in various wars have committed heinous acts of cruelty and slaughter against innocent men, women, and children. Yet they were not particularly evil or sadistic men; they were simply following orders. The research on obedience raises the chilling possibility that anyone of us would do the same thing in the same situation.

The potentially destructive power of religious authority was clearly demonstrated in 1978. In Jonestown, Guyana, more than 900 followers of religious-cult leader Jim Jones obeyed his orders and committed suicide by drinking poison. Christian leaders need to beware of the awesome power of their position, particularly when they claim to speak as the voice of God. \emph{(from Psychology and Christianity by Ronald Philipchalk, p.~214-215)}

\hypertarget{avoiding-destructive-obedience}{%
\subsection*{Avoiding Destructive Obedience}\label{avoiding-destructive-obedience}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Avoiding Destructive Obedience}

How can you protect yourself from participating in destructive obedience? Actually, you may have already taken the first step. Growing evidence suggests that when people learn about research findings such as these, they tend to change their behavior to take this knowledge into account (Sherman, 1980). There are, however, several more active steps you can take to reduce your vulnerability to malevolent authority.

\textbf{\emph{First}}, you can question the legitimacy of the authority. Ask yourself if the person giving the orders really has the right to command you to do what he or she is asking. Special uniforms, insignias, and titles can create an aura of authority even where none exists. For example, Brad Bushman found that 72 \% of pedestrians gave change to a young man when ordered to by a woman in uniform, compared to 48 \% when the woman was dressed in business clothes. Bushman found that the nature of the uniform did not even have to be related to the order being given (Bushman, 1984, 1988).

\textbf{\emph{Second}}, ask yourself if your obedience might cause harm to someone else. Remember that even if you act under legitimate authority you are still responsible for any harm you produce.

\textbf{\emph{Third}}, talk to others about your misgivings. This can not only strengthen your personal resolve, but it may also convince others to join you as well. In one field experiment, 21 out of 22 nurses were prepared to obey an unfamiliar physician whose order violated hospital policy and possibly endangered the patients. The nurses had no chance to consult with anyone else (Hofling et al., 1966). In a second study, however, when the nurses were given the opportunity to contact their supervisors and other nurses, only 2 out of 18 were willing to obey (Rank \& Jacobson, 1977).

Milgram also demonstrated the effect of support for disobedience. In one experiment he employed two additional confederates. They posed as co-teachers who, along with the real subject, gave shocks to the ``learner.'' One confederate refused to continue at 150 volts, the other confederate broke off at 210 volts. With this type of additional support, 90 \% of the subjects refused to go all the way to the maximum shock---total obedience was reduced to 10 \% (Milgram, 1974).

\textbf{\emph{Finally}}, if you decide to defy authority, you might take a lesson from the conformity research and remember the power of calm, reasonable dissent. One of the most famous literary examples of defiance, Herman Melville's Bartleby, the Scrivener, illustrates this ``gentle rebellion:''

\emph{``Bartleby,''} said I, \emph{``Ginger Nut is away; just step round to the Post Office, won't you?} (it was but a three minute walk), \emph{and see if there is anything for me.''}

\emph{``I would prefer not to.''}

\emph{``You will not?''}

\emph{``I prefer not.''}

I staggered to my desk, and sat there in a deep study. My blind inveteracy returned. Was there any other thing in which I could procure myself to be ignominiously repulsed by this lean, penniless wight?---my hired clerk? What added thing is there, perfectly reasonable, that he will be sure to refuse to do?

\emph{``Bartleby''} - No answer

\emph{``Bartleby,''} in a louder tone. - No answer.

\emph{``Bartleby,''} I roared.

Like a very ghost, agreeably to the laws of magical invocation, at the third summons, he appeared at the entrance of his hermitage.

\emph{``Go to the next room, and tell Nippers to come to me.''}

\emph{``I prefer not to,''} he respectfully and slowly said, and mildly disappeared.

Bartleby manages to defy his employer and yet keep his job because his meek reply is so disarming. At times a more aggressive stance may be necessary, but remember, resistance is always possible. Obedience should not be blind. \emph{(from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ronald Philipchalk)}

This unit, we learned about obedience. We saw that obedience is strongest level of social influence. This will be the focus of this unit's Learning Lab. In order to prepare for discussion this week, take a moment to consider the following resources:

\end{itemize}

\emph{As mentioned earlier, it is not necessary to read each resource thoroughly. What is important is to gain comprehension of the importance of using ethical guidelines when doing research on conformity, compliance, and obedience. Start to ponder how necessary is it to involve the use of deception in research. Ask yourself how you would feel if you were actually part of an experiment that was measuring compliance and you were deceived about what the researchers were actually doing? Also, while reading this information have you been able to recognize areas of your life where you are unquestionably following an authority figure? When answering questions like this I would encourage you to not be overly critical of yourself or others, rather, just notice where certain phenomena are present in your life and if you would like to do anything about it.}

Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following scenario and questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week's Learning Lab:

\emph{When people read about Stanley Milgram's experiments on obedience to au­thor­ity, they are often puzzled at the ethics of this research. You have probably have heard of these studies before and already have some views about the ap­propriate­ness of the procedures. All psychologists follow ethical guidelines in their research established by national governing bodies (e.g., CPA, APA). At the heart of these state­ments about ethics are the responsibilities to: protect the subject's welfare, avoid deception, provide anonymity, and provide therapy or relief from any unin­tended results of the experiment. Each of these general principles applies to the Milgram studies. Do you believe that the studies could be conducted today, given what we know now about ethics and about Milgram's results?}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Does the severity of the problem studied---in this case destructive obedience---justify more extreme steps to manipulate and deceive experimental subjects?}}\\
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Under what circumstances do you personally think that deceiving subjects in a scientific experiment might be ethically warranted or justified?}}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{compliance}{%
\section{Compliance}\label{compliance}}

This fictitious letter, based upon actual appeals I have received, contains several examples of techniques of persuasion. Without criticizing the writer's motives, a social psychologist could identify examples of card stacking, plain folks, foot-in-the-door, and other effective procedures of persuasion that we will discuss below.

Compliance refers to an intermediate level of influence. Here we have the familiar situation where a request is made of us, but it is assumed that we have a choice; we don't have to comply with the persuasive communication. In the letter we see the use of several techniques which have been found to increase the effectiveness of a persuasive communication:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Card Stacking}} is the selection of only those examples which support the proponent's argument (Mr.~Smith's example is presented as if it were typical).\\
\item
  \textbf{\emph{The Band Wagon Effect}} gives the impression that many other people are involved, and that everyone is doing it (``thousands of others are standing with you'').\\
\item
  \textbf{\emph{A Testimonial}} is a personal example of the successful application of the proponent's argument (Mr.~Smith provides a concrete example of what might be expected).\\
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Plain Folks}} refers to the association of the person or product with simple ordinary people (``this poor country boy'').\\
\item
  \textbf{\emph{The foot-in-the-door technique}} is the attempt to get you to comply in a small way, knowing that this greatly increases your chance of complying to a larger request (in our example reading the letter, using the ``prayer square,'' or sending a very small donation are small requests which could be followed up with requests for larger gifts).\\
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Name Calling}} is a technique which persuades people to reject something which they may know nothing about (``the forces of evil'').\\
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Transfer}} is the association of a person or product with something that people already feel strongly about (``God,'' ``family,'' ``children'').
\end{enumerate}

These and other techniques have been shown to greatly increase the effectiveness of a persuasive communication. They are often quite apparent in appeals by religious leaders for financial support. Should Christians use these techniques of influence? \emph{(from Psychology and Christianity by Ronald Philipchalk, p.~211, 213)}

\emph{The purpose of the information being shared in this topic and through these resources is to help you recognize who and/or what you are allowing to be an influence in your life? Asking the question, ``Who is teaching me how to be influential and what direction is that influence taking me in?'' can be invaluable in helping you examine how you are spending your time and if you are truly satisfied in the direction of your life. Remember, tools of influence are just that -- tools. Any tool can be used towards benefit or detriment, it just depends on how it is being applied.}

If you have not been taught a sales technique, you certainly have experienced many as a consumer. Can you give an example? Here is one:

\textbf{\emph{One of the standard ways that door-to-door salespersons will try to get you to buy something is the so-called foot-in-the-door technique: They will ask you to do them a small favor. Having done so, you will have to justify your own behavior to yourself by think­ing nice things about the seller. Hence, you are more likely to comply when they ask you to sign on the dotted line.}}
