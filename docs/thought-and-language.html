<h2>Overview<a href="thought-and-language.html#overview" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><strong><em>Welcome to Psych 106</em></strong></p>
<p>We begin this course by reviewing some important information on scientific research methodologies. While this review will be self-guided, it is critical that you understand the important elements that constitute valid and reliable scientific research as it is these methodologies that serve as the backbone for psychological studies.</p>
<p>After taking time to review scientific research methodologies, we will turn our attention to the subject of Thought and Language. Developing an understanding of Thought and Language helps us better understand how we think, how we organize our thoughts and our knowledge of the world around us, and how we communicate and act out on this information.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> What is Psychology<a href="thought-and-language.html#what-is-psychology" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>We begin our course with a quick challenge: <strong><em>In your own words, define “psychology.”</em></strong></p>
<p>According to your definition, how is psychology different from other academic areas that would study humans (<em>for example, philosophy, literature, or history</em>)? If you said “Pyschology is different because it uses the scientific method”- give yourself a pat on the back</p>
<p>You will begin your study of the scientific method by reading your textbook. The parable below (<em>from Philipchalk’s Social Psychology textbook</em>), however, helps illustrate the scientific method with three “helpful” approaches to a problem, including a simple experiment:</p>
<p><em>Once upon a time there were three brothers. One day while they were working in their father’s field, they saw an old man coming along the road. The old man greeted them, and then struggled on along the road, limping terribly. After that, every day at the same time, the brothers greeted the old man and watched as he hobbled by. When a month had passed, they were so impressed that they each did something. The first brother wrote a compelling story about perseverance in the face of the ravages of old age. It encouraged many people. The second brother painted a moving portrait of the old man, stooped over and limping along. People were inspired. The third brother, who had observed the old man very closely, asked him one day if he could exchange shoes with him. The old man was surprised, but he gladly agreed. When the old man walked away he did not limp. The next day the third brother gave the old man his shoes back and watched as he limped on his way. On the third day, the brother again exchanged shoes with the old man. Then he took the old man’s shoes to a shoemaker and had them repaired. When the brother gave them back to the old man he was delighted. The old man put on the shoes, thanked the brother, and walked away without a limp.</em></p>
<p>Although each brother made a positive contribution, the third brother solved the man’s problem because he discovered its cause. To do this, <strong><em>he used the scientific method and he conducted an experiment (Philipchalk, 1994).</em></strong></p>
<p>I think psychology is one of the most interesting areas of study there is, first, because it studies people, people like you and me, and we’re interesting Second, I like psychology because it is so broad. Psychologists, as you will soon see, study everything from nerve conduction in single cells, all the way to the influence of groups on our behaviour—and everything in between. Finally, psychologists don’t just speculate and theorize, they look for evidence for their ideas. If they don’t find sufficient evidence, they change their ideas; and I like that. Which leads us back to the scientific method and how psychology began.</p>

<div id="algorithms-heuristics" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Algorithms &amp; Heuristics<a href="thought-and-language.html#algorithms-heuristics" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Algorithms and heuristics can be confusing. An algorithm is a guaranteed route to a solution, but it may be the long way around to success. If you knew a person lived somewhere in a large residence hall, an algorithm for finding that individual would be to knock on every door until you located the person. Heuristics, on the other hand, sug­gest that you would first ask friends where to locate the person, or check a list, then knock on the appropriate door to locate the person. Another way to think of heuristics is the phrase “rule of thumb.” Can you think of some rules of thumb that you have learned from your various job experiences? They may have to do with how long to cook a hamburger, or when to refill a machine, or how to get a date.</p>
<p>Consider the following example and explanation taken from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ron Philipchalk:</p>
<!-- [plugin:content-inject](../_1-1)-->
<p><em>In the second part of the book, they tell you how to crack a safe. There are all kinds of ninny-pinny, dopey things, like “It might be a good idea to try a date for the combination, because lots of people like to use dates.” Or “Think of the psychology of the owner of the safe, and what he might use for the combination.” And “The secretary is often worried that she might forget the combination of the safe, so she might write it down in one of the following places—along the edge of her desk drawer, on a list of names and addresses . . .” and so on . . . .</em></p>
<p><em>I also did a certain amount of systematic study. For instance, a typical combination was 69-32-21. How far off could a number be when you’re opening the safe? If the number was 69, would 68 work? Would 67 work? On the particular locks we had, the answer was yes for both, but 66 wouldn’t work. You could be off by two in either direction. That meant you only had to try one out of five numbers, so you could try zero, five, ten, fifteen, and so on. With twenty such numbers on a wheel of 100, that was 8000 possibilities instead of the 1,000,000 you would get if you had to try every single number. . . .</em></p>
<p><em>I practiced all the time on my own safe so I could do this process as fast as I could and not get lost in my mind as to which number I was pushing and mess up the first number. Like a guy who practices sleight of hand, I got it down to an absolute rhythm so I could try the 400 possible back numbers in less than half an hour. That meant I could open a safe in a maximum of eight hours—with an average time of four hours. (Surely You’re Joking Mr. Feynman, p. 140)</em></p>
<p>Mr. Feynman’s safecracking system succeeds because he methodically works through every possible combination. By logical analysis he has discovered which 8,000 possibilities out of 1,000,000 he needs to try. We call this type of logical step-by-step procedure for solving problems an algorithm (Newell &amp; Simon, 1972; Simon, 1981). If you use the correct algorithm your success is guaranteed.</p>
<p>But sometimes it can take a long time to discover the correct algorithm. And employing an algorithm is often time consuming. Mr. Feynman spent days developing his system and it took hours to open a safe. You could certainly open a safe much faster if you found the combination on the edge of the secretary’s drawer.</p>
<p>The shortcuts Mr. Feynman calls “ninny-pinny, dopey things” are examples of heuristics. Heuristics are rule-of-thumb strategies for solving problems, shortcuts we develop from our experience. Heuristics often help us eliminate improbable alternatives and guide us to the most likely solution to a problem. Despite his appreciation for algorithms, Mr. Feynman discovered heuristics can be useful. He found, for example, that safe owners often did not bother to change the factory set combination when they received a new safe. In one office building the temporary factory combinations 25-0-25 or 50-25-50 opened one safe in five</p>
<p>Algorithms and heuristics are examples of cognitive strategies—mental plans we use to make decisions and solve problems.</p>

<p>Your Learning Lab for this unit will focus on group discussion as explore the topics of this unit in more detail. As you prepare for your Learning Lab, one possible scenario that discussion will focus on is below- please prepare some thoughts to share with the group:</p>
<p>In the largest sense, society is breaking into two classes:</p>
<p><em>The first class are people who know how to think. These people realize that most problems are open to examination and creative solution. If a problem appears in the lives of these people, their intellectual training will quickly lead them to a solution or an alternative statement of the problem. These people are the source of the most important product in today’s economy – ideas.</em></p>
<p><em>The second class, the vast majority of society, are people who cannot think for themselves. I call these people ‘idea consumers’ – metaphorically speaking, they wander around in a gigantic open-air mall of facts and ideas. The content of their experience is provided by television, the Internet and other shallow data pools. These people believe collecting images and facts makes them educated and competent, and all their experiences reinforce this belief. The central, organizing principle of this class is that ideas come from somewhere else, from magical persons, geniuses, ‘them.’</em></p>
<p>Consider the following prompts to help better prepare for the discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Do you agree or disagree with this claim?</em></strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong><em>Do you know people that fit in the second category? What causes this difference? How might it be changed?</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>
## Cognitive Biases

As if the biases mentioned in the textbook are not enough, here are a few more to watch out for, taken from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ron Philipchalk.

### The Gambler&#39;s Fallacy {-}

Jill and Bob are the parents of three boys. Jill is pregnant again, and she and Bob are hoping the baby is a girl. In fact, they are confident the baby must be a girl because their previous three children were boys. If you agree with Jill and Bob that the baby is more likely to be a girl than a boy, then you—along with Jill and Bob—may be committing the gambler&#39;s fallacy. No matter how many boys have been born, the likelihood of a girl being born is the same as it always was, approximately 50 % (assuming no biological abnormality or medical intervention).

The gambler&#39;s fallacy arises from our failure to recognize the independence of unconnected events. The result of a coin toss does not depend on the outcome of previous tosses; a child&#39;s sex at conception is not affected by the sex of prior conceptions; the cards dealt in a hand are not influenced by the distribution of cards on the previous deal; and so on. Each event in these sequences is independent of the others, although we tend to think that somehow there must be a connection.

### The Anchoring and Adjustment Heuristic {-}

First impressions of a person exert a powerful influence on the way we interpret subsequent information about that person. This effect may be an example of a more general principle called the anchoring and adjustment heuristic. Information we use to establish a starting value (or anchor point) tends to be more influential in our decisions than subsequent information we use to adjust this value (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974).

Daniel Cervone and his colleagues found, for example, that initial success or failure on a task can establish an anchor for feelings of self-efficacy. Students who initially succeed on a task and later fail have higher feelings of self-efficacy than students who initially fail and later succeed even though their overall level of success is the same. Final judgments of self-efficacy are biased in the direction of initial judgments (Cervone &amp; Palmer, 1990; Peake &amp; Cervone, 1989).

Salespeople often use the anchoring and adjustment heuristic to their advantage. Some real estate agents routinely show their clients an over-priced and unattractive house first in order to set an anchor point which, in effect, says, &quot;The kind of house you want is going to cost a lot.&quot; Once established, this expectation of high price changes very slowly and the clients are relieved to find an acceptable house in their price range (Northcraft &amp; Neale, 1987).

Car dealers too like us to set our sights high. Their so-called list price establishes an anchor or reference point that overshadows our subsequent evaluations, as I recently discovered. In looking for a certain model of car, I was attracted to a particular vehicle with an asking price of $3,800 (&quot;reduced from $4,200&quot;). I believed this price was too high, so I bargained with the vendor. Eventually, I bought the car for $2,800. Did the high original asking price affect my decision? Yes, it probably did. Subsequent events indicated I still paid too much. I later bought an identical model in only slightly poorer condition for $2,000. I was a victim of the anchoring and adjustment heuristic.

***Contrast Effects***

My car purchase also illustrates a related distortion in judgment, the contrast effect. In contrast to the original price of $4,200 my offer of $2,800 seemed like a bargain. John Lynch, Jr. and his colleagues (1991) found a similar effect with students. The students rated low-priced cars as less expensive when they were considered alongside high-priced cars (contrast effect), compared to when they were considered along with other low-priced cars (no contrast).

Research by Douglass Kenrick and his colleagues indicates that we also show contrast effects in evaluating other people. In one study (1980), male college students rated the attractiveness of potential blind dates. Subjects who gave their ratings after watching a TV show with attractive female actresses rated the potential dates as less attractive than did subjects who rated their potential dates before watching the show. In another study (1989), after viewing centerfold erotica, men found average women—and even their own wives—less attractive.

### Heuristics &amp; Biases {-}

By now you may be wondering why we fall prey to so many cognitive biases and errors. Well don’t worry; our biases are actually a side effect of our cognitive efficiency. Most of our biases result from using heuristics, rules of thumb, or mental shortcuts that work very well. Sometimes they let us down, but overall, they improve the speed with which we handle mental problems—much like Mr. Feynman’s safe-cracking tricks. As we noted in the previous discussion, you could certainly open a safe much faster if you found the combination on the edge of the secretary&#39;s drawer. However, you won’t always find the combination there, so limiting yourself to this approach would produce a kind of “cognitive bias” in your safe-cracking strategy.

***Give an example from your own experience of one of the cognitive biases, discussed here or in the textbook, that you have fallen prey to.***



## Language and Thought

### Linguistic Relativity {-}

Benjamin Whorf’s linguistic relativity hypothesis suggests that our language affects the way we see the world. Do you know any examples of weather terms, for example, that are unique to one area? Could knowing these terms help you to notice differences in weather that outsiders might not notice? What about in sports? Sports fans usually know terms to de­scribe certain strokes or plays. Does knowledge of these terms affect percep­tion? Can you think of some examples? What does it mean to “clothesline” someone, or “post-up,” or “birdie?”

### Imaginary Practice {-}

Mental practice is now widely accepted in many areas. The following excerpt is taken from the [**GolfPsych**](https://www.golfpsych.com){target=&quot;_blank”} website. You may find further examples there as well.

&quot;You can practice the mental aspects of your game anytime. We encourage our clients to do imagery practice of playing well in upcoming tournaments. This imaginary practice includes seeing the course, situation, doing a full mental pre-shot routine and seeing a good shot. You should also be feeling the way you do when you play your best. In addition, you should be practicing deep breathing and quieting your mind off-course. This is an extremely valuable tool that must be practiced to be effective. The mental game is much more than thinking positive thoughts. Take our Personality Assessment and get your own GolfPsych Report to receive our recommendations for you based on your personality and our research. Reading our book will also help you understand all aspects of a good mental game. During your practices and before your rounds you should also be practicing your mental skills.&quot;

&lt;span class=&quot;blockhead&quot;&gt;Learning Lab Preparation&lt;/span&gt;

The subject of our focus for this Topic has been on the power of language in influencing how we see the world. Our discussion during Learning Lab this week will focus on the importance of language in the Bible (and other religious writings) and how it &quot;shapes&quot; how we see the world.

To prepare for this discussion, consider the following prompt:

***Give some examples of the importance of language in the Bible or other religious writings.***
&lt;/div&gt;\EndKnitrBlock{reflect}

## Animal Language

### Language {-}

As a Christian I am pleased to see in psychology the resurgence of interest in studying some of what Ronald Koteskey (1980) calls humanity&#39;s &quot;God-like&quot; characteristics, creativity, imagery, and particularly language.

The use of words is extremely important in Christian scripture. God spoke the creation into existence; Jesus is called the Word; the significance of Babel and Pentecost are closely linked to the importance of language; and there is great power associated with an individual&#39;s name. In addition, Christians have usually considered the ability to communicate with words to be part of the image of God in man. However, recently several researchers claim to have taught animals, usually chimpanzees or apes, to communicate through language. Using sign language, blocks, or keyboards and computer- generated voices, the animals have signaled their needs and even generated word combinations.

But is this truly language? There is no doubt that the animals are using symbols as signs to stand for objects and actions. However, there are significant questions being raised about the comparison with human language.

Christians need to think carefully about what they mean when they talk about the image of God in man. The area of human learning and psycholinguistics offers some intriguing questions for thoughtful Christians. What is the origin of human speech-is it learned (as Skinner would say) or largely innate (as Chomsky would say)? Is human speech unique? Do the studies of language in animals necessitate a redefinition of the uniqueness of man? (Based on Psychology and Christianity by Ron Philipchalk, p. 102)

## Assessment {-}

\BeginKnitrBlock{assessment}&lt;div class=&quot;assessment&quot;&gt;
While there is no &quot;formal&quot; assignment that you will be responsible for submitting for Unit 1, you will be expected to participate in discussion during your Learning Lab. Your facilitator will be providing a participation mark based on your contributions. Below is some information to consider prior to attending your Learning Lab:

*Active participation in group exercises, reflection, and critical discourse is an essential component of this course. You are expected to show respect for all members of the course, both in your speech and actions. Contribute by actively observing and listening, raising thoughtful questions, examining relevant issues, building on others’ ideas, analyzing and evaluating the group’s thinking, synthesizing key points, and expanding the group’s perspectives. Take care not to dominate a conversation, giving space for others to speak. When in small groups help maintain the focus, flow, and quality of conversations, and take the initiative to invite others (particularly those who are quiet) to speak.*

# Intelligence Testing

## Overview {-}

In this unit, you will learn about techniques and tools for measuring intelligence, different theories as to what constitutes intelligence, and the biological, environmental, and behavioural factors that influence intelligence.

### Topics {-}

This unit is divided into the following topics:

1. What is Intelligence?  
2. Extremes of Intelligence  
3. Nature-Nature and IQ  

### Learning Outcomes {-}

By the end of this unit, students will be able to:

- Know and define the key terminology associated with understanding intelligence, intelligence testing, and heredity, environment, and intelligence.  
- Understand the reasoning behind the eugenics movements and its use of intelligence tests, why intelligence is divided into fluid and crystallized types, and the genetic basis of intelligence.  
- Apply the concepts of entity theory and incremental theory to help kids succeed in school, to identify examples from the triarchic and multiple theories of intelligence, and to recognize environmental and behavioural effects on intelligence to understand how to enhance your own cognitive abilities.  
- Analyze why it is difficult to remove all cultural bias from intelligence testing and whether teachers should spend time tailoring lessons to each individual student’s learning style.

## What is Intelligence?

### Intelligence {-}

As David Myers points out, intelligence is a slippery concept. We all have an idea of what it refers to, but we cannot agree on a single definition. Perhaps the most helpful advice is to remember, as Myers points out, that “intelligence is a socially constructed concept. Cultures deem ‘intelligent’ whatever attributes enable success in those cultures” (2010). Historically, in North American culture, the idea of intelligence performance on an IQ test. The composition of these tests reflected North American culture’s emphasis on particular mental abilities, specifically, those associated with success in an academic setting. More recently, we have come to realize that there are many kinds of intelligence. In this unit we will consider some varieties of intelligence, or multiple intelligences.

### Types of Intelligence {-}

#### Emotional Intelligence {-}

I have to admit that when I first heard of emotional intelligence (EI) I was skeptical. It sounded like popular psychology - someone trying to make a buck preying on our need for self-knowledge. However, upon further investigation I found that EI was linked to social intelligence (the ability to understand and relate to people), a concept developed by the pioneering psychologist E.L. Thorndike in 1920. And upon still further investigation, I found EI made a lot of sense.

#### Sternberg&#39;s Three Components of Intelligence {-}

Robert Sternberg wanted to show that intelligence was more than just one general ability (known as *g theory*). He believed our intelligence is best classified into three areas that predict real - world success: ***analytical, creative, and practical.*** The following article does a great job explaining the Triarchic Theory of Intelligence and its three sub-theories. It also makes note of the criticisms that have been brought against this theory. *To better understand Sternberg’s Three Components of Intelligence follow the link below:*

- [**Three Components of Intelligence**](https://www.thoughtco.com/triarchic-theory-of-intelligence-4172497){target=&quot;_blank”}

#### Howard Gardner’s Nine Types of Intelligence  {-}

Howard Gardner put together a robust, research-based theory of Multiple Intelligences. He put forth an understanding of intelligence promoting our abilities are best classified into nine independent intelligences, which include a broad range of skills beyond traditional school smarts. This illuminating read that can help you understand what your primary intelligences are. Follow the link below:

### Activity: Intelligence Testing  {-}

\BeginKnitrBlock{reflect}&lt;div class=&quot;reflect&quot;&gt;
In this unit we investigated Intelligence Testing. One of the important concepts we learned was that Intelligence Testing can be controversial due to its socially constructed nature.

Below is a link to a website that will allow you to take some Intelligence Tests for yourself. As you work through each test, and see the results, think about why we might consider these types of tests beneficial, and why they might be considered controversial.

&lt;span class=&quot;blockhead&quot;&gt;Learning Lab Preparation&lt;/span&gt;

Our Learning Lab for this unit will focus on Intelligence Testing. As we have seen, Intelligence Testing is best implemented after careful consideration - this will be the focus of our discussion during this unit&#39;s Learning Lab. To help you prepare, consider the following questions:

- ***How do you feel about the EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE TESTS? Did you learn anything? If so, what were the important areas that were illumined by the test?***  
- ***Is ‘emotional intelligence’ a valid concept worth measuring?***  
- ***Do you believe E-IQ is more important than &quot;intelligence&quot; as measured by IQ scores for success and happiness in your life?”***  
&lt;/div&gt;\EndKnitrBlock{reflect}

## Extremes of Intelligence

### IQ Testing {-}

In this section we continue to build upon our understanding of intelligence and testing to focus on Intelligence tests and those who score at the &quot;extremes.&quot; Intelligence tests are the most common tool used to measure intelligence. Intelligence test are one method of assessing an individual’s mental aptitudes and comparing them with those of others using numerical scores. These scores are then plotted on a normal (bell) curve to estimate where a person’s intelligence rates in relation to a standardized population. The extremes of intelligence is the understanding that on one end of the continuum are those with intellectual disabilities and on the other end are those who are geniuses.

\BeginKnitrBlock{reflect}&lt;div class=&quot;reflect&quot;&gt;
After considering the above, and having read the textbook’s discussion of intelligence testing, you might want to try some tests yourself. The value in doing this is not that you will get an accurate idea of your IQ score, but rather that you might get a better understanding for some of the problems in testing. As you try some of the tests at the following sites, remind yourself of the problems of test standardization, validity, and reliability. How well do you think these tests measure up?

&lt;span class=&quot;blockhead&quot;&gt;Learning Lab Preparation&lt;/span&gt;

As we prepare for our Learning Lab this week, we consider intelligence from a Christian perspective. Read the following passage and carefully consider the questions below to help prepare for our discussion:

*The Bible says, in James; Chapter 2:*

*My brothers, as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, don&#39;t show favoritism. Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in. If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, &quot;Here&#39;s a good seat for you,&quot; but say to the poor man, &quot;You stand there&quot; or &quot;Sit on the floor by my feet,&quot; have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?*

- ***Could we be guilty of favoritism in esteeming more intelligent people above less intelligent people? In society? In Church?***
&lt;/div&gt;\EndKnitrBlock{reflect}

## Nature-Nature and IQ

While the debate rages over the relative contributions of nature and nurture to IQ, no one denies that heredity (nature) plays some role. The question arises then, “So what?” Are we going to try to control (and presumably increase) IQ through genetic engineering or some other method of eugenics (*Eugenics is the search for hereditary factors that give people an evolutionary advantage; translated it can mean “good genes” or “good origin”*)? Are we going to control who should have children and how many, allowing the most intelligent parents to have more children and restricting the less intelligent? When the genetic basis for IQ (or some other component of intelligence) is identified, will parents select embryos with greater potential? For more on this topic see the following quote and the website from which it came.

“If we are concerned for the future of the (hopefully) millions of generations still to be born, we must realize that their fate lies to a considerable extent in the breeding practices of those who are currently alive.” *(Intelligence and Eugenics)*

#### What Will You Do?

If or when you have children, will you ban screens (TV, smart phone, tablet, laptop) as a “brain rotter” and read to them every day? Or will you just let nature take its course and allow both screens and reading?

#### Test Biases?

IQ tests are generally valid for their original purpose—as predictors of academic performance. Controversy arises when IQ scores are taken to mean overall intelligence and even overall worth. IQ scores consistently predict that some cultural and racial groups will do better at school than will other groups. These differences are an indication of bias not in the IQ tests but in the backgrounds and academic settings that first create and then magnify differences.

&lt;span class=&quot;blockhead&quot;&gt;Learning Lab Preparation&lt;/span&gt;

Consider the following scenario (and questions) as you continue to prepare for this unit&#39;s Learning Lab. You will be asked to share your thoughts so come prepared

*If you suggest that Asians have darker skin than Caucasians, you are not considered racist; this is an obvious fact with a genetic basis. However, if you suggest that Asians are more intelligent than Caucasians (as IQ tests show), or that African Americans are less intelligent, watch out

- ***What is different about these two claims that makes us accept one and not the other? Is it the role of nature versus nurture? Or is it more closely tied to the high value our culture places on intelligence, and especially IQ scores?***  
- ***If IQ were unimportant would it matter if one racial or gender group tended to score higher than another group? Would you be considered racist or sexist for suggesting this?***  
&lt;/div&gt;\EndKnitrBlock{reflect}

## Assessment {-}

\BeginKnitrBlock{assessment}&lt;div class=&quot;assessment&quot;&gt;
While there is no &quot;formal&quot; assignment that you will be responsible for submitting for Unit 2, you will be expected to participate in discussion during your Learning Lab. Your facilitator will be providing a participation mark based on your contributions. Below is some information to consider prior to attending your Learning Lab:

*Active participation in group exercises, reflection, and critical discourse is an essential component of this course. You are expected to show respect for all members of the course, both in your speech and actions. Contribute by actively observing and listening, raising thoughtful questions, examining relevant issues, building on others’ ideas, analyzing and evaluating the group’s thinking, synthesizing key points, and expanding the group’s perspectives. Take care not to dominate a conversation, giving space for others to speak. When in small groups help maintain the focus, flow, and quality of conversations, and take the initiative to invite others (particularly those who are quiet) to speak.*

**Rubric for Participation in Learning Labs**

&lt;/div&gt;\EndKnitrBlock{assessment}

## Checking your Learning {-}

\BeginKnitrBlock{progress}&lt;div class=&quot;progress&quot;&gt;
Before you move on to the next unit, check that you are able to:

- Define the key terminology associated with understanding intelligence, intelligence testing, and heredity, environment, and intelligence.  
- Understand the reasoning behind the eugenics movements and its use of intelligence tests, why intelligence is divided into fluid and crystallized types, and the genetic basis of intelligence.  
- Apply the concepts of entity theory and incremental theory to help kids succeed in school, to identify examples from the triarchic and multiple theories of intelligence, and to recognize environmental and behavioral effects on intelligence to understand how to enhance your own cognitive abilities.  
- Analyze why it is difficult to remove all cultural bias from intelligence testing and whether teachers should spend time tailoring lessons to each individual student’s learning style.

# The Developing Person - Part 1

## Overview {-}

Now that we have covered over some broad and influential topics in psychology, we begin our focus on human development. The focus of the content for this unit, will be on Chapter 10 in your textbook. As you turn ahead, you will notice that Chapter 10 contains a large amount of information - because of this, we will be covering it in this unit, and the next (Unit 4).

In this Unit (Part 1), you will learn about various strategies for researching human development, normal and abnormal prenatal development, and various cognitive, physical, and social developmental factors for infancy, childhood, and adolescence.

### Topics {-}

This unit is divided into the following topics:

 1. Prenatal Development  
 2. Infancy and Childhood  
 3. Adolescence  

### Learning Outcomes {-}

By the end of this unit, student&#39;s will be able to:

- Define the key terminology related to prenatal and infant physical development, infancy and childhood, and adolescent development.  
- Understand advantages and disadvantages to different research designs in developmental psychology.  
- Understand the cognitive changes that occur during infancy and childhood, and the importance of attachment and the different styles of attachment.  
- Understand the process of identity formation, relationships, and moral emotions during adolescence.  
- Apply your understanding to identify the best ways expectant parents can ensure the health of their developing fetus, how to promote learning, and how to categorize moral reasoning.  
- Analyze the effects of preterm birth, how to effectively discipline children, and adolescent judgment and risk taking.

## Prenatal Development

### Physical Development {-}

Prenatal development is a time of rapid growth and change. This rapid change continues throughout the first few years of life. Development during early life is clearly a function both of nature and of the environment.

&lt;!-- [plugin:content-inject](_alert) --&gt;

### Questions to Consider {-}

After you have read the first few pages of this chapter you should be able to answer the following questions:

- ***How is the gender of an offspring determined?***  
- ***What differentiates zygotes from embryos and embryos from fetuses?***  

*(These questions are intended for personal reflection - you are not intended to submit anything for assessment)*

### Designer Babies {-}

It is beginning to look inevitable that, however fierce the debate, the technology to make designer babies will happen - maybe just 20 years from now. Geneticists claim to have found the gene for good-parenting, genes for obesity, Alzheimer&#39;s, red hair, and even happiness. Incredibly, scientists have even constructed an artificial human chromosome, which could carry any genes a geneticist - or prospective parents - desired.

Embryo A technique called Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) is already being used to screen embryos for genetic diseases. Embryos created outside the body using in vitro fertilization are tested to see whether they carry a genetic disorder before being transferred to the uterus. It&#39;s deeply controversial whether parents should ever be allowed to select embryos just because they&#39;re genetically different.

At the moment the technique is used for therapeutic purposes only, to screen for children who may have a deadly genetic disease. Even if some parents and their doctors were willing to use PGD for cosmetic or enhancement purposes, which remains absolutely taboo, the technique is limited in a crucial way - PGD can only select an embryo with genes inherited from the parents.

***Bottled Genes?*** *One day parents may be able to pick any gene they desire from a range of bottled genes and have it put into their embryos. (quoted from &quot;Designer Babies&quot; website)*

&lt;!-- [plugin:content-inject](_activities) --&gt;

### Activity: Designer Babies {-}

\BeginKnitrBlock{reflect}&lt;div class=&quot;reflect&quot;&gt;
This activity involves some reading and reflection around the topic of genetic engineering. As this is a contemporary issue, it will be valuable to familiarize yourself with some of the complexities of this technology and think critically about some of the ethical challenges. Your task is to read the following resources and carefully consider the implications of this technology:

- [**Editing the DNA of Embryos with CRISPR**](https://www.statnews.com/2019/09/16/could-editing-the-dna-of-embryos-with-crispr-help-save-people-who-are-already-alive/){target=&quot;_blank”}

1. ***How do you feel about this request?***
2. ***What problems might you anticipate?***
&lt;/div&gt;\EndKnitrBlock{reflect}

## Infancy and Childhood

### A Child’s View of God {-}

One evening on a camping trip several years ago, my wife and I listened outside the tent as our five-year-old Joelle and three-year-old Matthew tried to get to sleep. Always the &quot;mother,&quot; Joelle attempted to dispel her little brother&#39;s fear of bears and other wild creatures by reminding him that Jesus was watching over them. Not content with generalities, Matt responded, &quot;Does Jesus got a gun?&quot; *(Psychology and Christianity by Ronald Philipchalk, p. 141)*

As any Sunday School teacher knows, children see God differently from adults—often in very concrete terms (protection requires a gun!). Studying cognitive development can help us to understand as well as teach children at their own level.

### The Process of Cognitive Change {-}

Our textbook provides a good summary of the structure (stages) of cognitive development. The section, however, does not address the process by which a person moves from one stage to the next. Piaget believed that the key to cognitive development is something called cognitive conflict or cognitive disequilibrium. For cognitive development to proceed, the individual must constantly re-evaluate his or her schemas. According to Piaget, we develop schemas from an early age of life. Schemas are our cognitive representations of the world. Schemas help us to organize our experiences. They also allow us to make predictions about what outcomes might result from particular behaviours. Schemas are very important in helping us to understand and to adapt to the world.

Although schemas are important in helping us to understand the world, they are not always accurate. People at all ages can have mental representations of the world that are not correct.

***Can you think of any examples of inaccurate schemas?***

Although people at all ages can have inaccurate mental representations of the world, children are especially prone to view the world in an incorrect way. The reason children may view the world in an incorrect way is because the structure of their cognitive processing is developing. Piaget believed that inaccurate schemas are changed only when they are challenged in the cognitive structure of the child. This challenge has been termed cognitive conflict.


Basically, the process of cognitive change works as follows:

- People are motivated to maintain a state of cognitive equilibrium.  
- When a child encounters information from the world and the information is inconsistent with his or her schema, the new piece of information creates a state of disequilibrium or cognitive conflict.  
- ***Equilibrium*** may be restored through one of the two processes of adapation called assimilation and accommodation.  
- ***Assimilation*** occurs when a child re-organizes the new information in such a way as to make the new piece of information consistent with his or her preexisting schema of the world.  
- ***Accommodation*** occurs when a child alters his or her schema such that the new piece of information can now be incorporated into the new schema.  

Thus the process of accommodation produces the greatest cognitive change. Can you think of examples of both assimilation and accommodation? Here is an example:

**Equilibrium-Preexisting Schema:** Child has grown up in an environment where all people he interacted with were of the same race (mom, dad, siblings, grandma, grandpa, etc.) Child has seen people of other racial groups, but has never interacted with them. Child develops the schema that people tend to like others who are of the same race as him or her.

**Cognitive Conflict Produced:** At four years of age the child begins to attend preschool. At this time he starts to interact with children of various races. The child begins to develop a friendship with a child of a different race. This friendship creates cognitive conflict for the child: &quot;How can I like someone who is a different color?&quot; To resolve this cognitive conflict, the child has two options:

***Option A***- **Assimilation:** In order to maintain his or her preexisting schema, the child re-organizes the information such that the other child is not perceived to be so dissimilar after all: &quot;Maybe he is a different color from me, but we both speak English. We must not be so dissimilar after all.&quot;

***Option B***- **Accommodation:** The child&#39;s preexisting schema is altered such that the new information can be incorporated into a new way of perceiving the world, &quot;Maybe I can be friends with someone who is different from me.&quot;

### Cognitive Equilibrium is Restored {-}

Although cognitive equilibrium is restored via either assimilation or accommodation, assimilation serves to maintain an inaccurate schema (that differences inhibit the development of friendships) whereas accommodation serves to produce cognitive change and hence produces a more accurate representation of the world (that differences do not inhibit the development of friendships).

Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week&#39;s Learning Lab:

 - ***What is God like for children of different levels of cognitive development? If you can, give some examples from children you know....***  
 - ***Would children even have an idea of God if they were not taught it?***

## Adolescence

John has just turned 13. Over the past year he has experienced may changes. He has grown over six inches and he has developed acne over his face and back. Not only is he changing physically, he is also experiencing a wave of emotional, spiritual, cognitive, and sexual changes. John has become self-focused and very self-critical. In addition, he is beginning to think abstractly and to challenge adults&#39; &quot;dominion&quot; on knowledge. John is also on a quest to understand &quot;who he is&quot; and &quot;what his place is in the world&quot;. John&#39;s quest for an identity makes him more vulnerable to peer pressure and to the influence of radical groups and cults. During this time that we call adolescence, John will make many decisions that will have a profound effect on the direction his life will take.

*Does any of the above sound familiar?*

Before you begin reading the textbook section on adolescence, think back to your own adolescence. As you think about your experience of adolescence, use the following questions to guide your reflection:

- What physical changes did you experience in adolescence?  
- How did these physical changes make you feel?  
- In what ways did your view of the world change during adolescence?  
- How did your way of treating other people change during adolescence?  
- What was most important to you during adolescence?  
- To what extent is &quot;who you are today&quot; a function of &quot;who you became during adolescence&quot;?  

### No Adolescence? {-}

In other times and in other cultures to­day, adolescence does not exist as a significant and distinct period of develop­ment. This might seem surprising and difficult to imagine. Think of how modern society would be different, or if it could even exist, without a period of adolescence. What are the advantages and disadvantages of having an adolescent period?

### Identity  {-}

The concept of identity is a rich topic for consideration. The most familiar aspect of identity is occupational identity, since much of “who we are” in our society rests on the kind of work we do. Perhaps you can readily relate to this in your choice of major. Less familiar, but equally important, is ideological identity. Ideologi­cal identity, including both religious and political orientations, may un­dergo a tremen­dous upheaval during your student years. Do you have the same political beliefs as your parents? What about religious beliefs? Conflict and questioning of parental beliefs and values may be a necessary part of establishing your personal iden­tity—even if the beliefs and values you ultimately adopt are the same as those of your parents.

<div id="psychosocial-development" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Psychosocial Development<a href="thought-and-language.html#psychosocial-development" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>There are many changes we experience during the time we call adulthood. According to Erikson’s theory of psychosocial development, adults move through three important stages during which they must resolve important psychosocial conflicts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early Adulthood<br />
</li>
<li>Middle Adulthood<br />
</li>
<li>Late Adulthood</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>In Early Adulthood</em></strong> (20-40 years of age) the psychosocial crisis is one of intimacy versus isolation. Although it is often perceived as critical whether or not the person develops an intimate relationship with a lifelong partner, Erikson believed that although this is one component of intimacy in this stage, other types of intimacy are also important—like developing intimate relationships with workmates, colleagues, and even one’s children. If one fails to develop a sense of intimacy during this stage, he or she will feel isolation.</p>
<p><strong><em>In Middle Adulthood</em></strong> (40-65 years of age) the psychosocial crises is one of generativity versus stagnation. What is generativity? Erikson used the term gererativity to describe the process by which a person feels like he or she is making a lasting contribution in the world. Usually, generativity involves giving something back to the next generation. People at this stage can feel generative in many ways—coaching a softball team, being a scout leader, teaching children in Sunday School, been a big brother/sister, etc. If a person fails to develop a sense of generativity during this stage, he or she will feel a sense of stagnation.</p>
<p><strong><em>In Late Adulthood</em></strong> (65+ years of age) the psychosocial crisis is one of ego integrity versus despair. If the individual looks back on his or her life and feels a sense of pride in the accomplishments he or she has made, then the individual will feel a sense of ego integrity. However, if the person looks back on his or her life and does not see the significance of his or her accomplishments, then he or she will feel a sense of despair at the meaninglessness of his or her life.</p>
</div>
<div id="guilt" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Guilt<a href="thought-and-language.html#guilt" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>One of the most significant developments in childhood, from both a secular and Christian point of view, is a conscience with its attendant guilt. Is guilt simply a conditioned emotional response (as the behaviorist might say)? Is it the result of conflict with the superego (as a psychoanalyst would say)? Is it the failure to live up to our self-concept (as the humanist might say)? Is it the voice of the Holy Spirit? Or is it some combination of these? (For help on this issue and an important distinction between false and true guilt see Counts and Narramore (1970), Narramore (1984), Tournier (1962).) <em>(from Psychology and Christianity, by Ronald Philipchalk, p. 146)</em></p>
<p>The textbook discusses moral development in childhood and adolescence. However, many adults are troubled by questions of right and wrong, and in particular, by feelings of guilt. The Christian authors noted above suggest that many guilt feelings are not true guilt but false guilt carried over from childhood experiences. Understanding how conscience and guilt feelings develop can help to liberate us from unnecessary false guilt inappropriately attributed to God.</p>

<div id="death" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Death<a href="thought-and-language.html#death" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Secular psychologists see death as final. Christians, however, see resurrection beyond, with death being but another step in that direction. What implications do these beliefs have for the process of dying?</p>
<p>As medical technology has advanced death has become more and more difficult to define. We need to focus our attention less on preserving the physical and more on preserving the personhood of the individual. This means giving greater attention to our concept of the dying person created in the image of God (as the abortion issue has forced us to do at the other end of life). When is personhood sacrificed to technical efficiency? Should we advocate a more “natural death?” What is “natural death?” How far does one go in “allowing” natural death? <em>(from Psychology and Christianity, by Ronald Philipchalk, p. 146)</em></p>

<div id="hospice" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Hospice<a href="thought-and-language.html#hospice" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>You matter because of who you are. You matter to the last moment of your life, and we will do all we can not only to help you die peacefully, but also to live until you die.” <em>(Dame Cicely Saunders)</em></p>
<p>During the Crusades of the Middle Ages a hospice provided lodging for travelers: a place of refuge and comfort. So in 1967, when Dame Cicley Saunders opened a facility in London to provide care and comfort to dying people and their families, St. Christopher’s hospice was an appropriate name. <em>(Courtesy of the Langley Hospice Society)</em></p>

<p>In addition to your participation in this unit’s Learning Lab, you will also be responsible for two formal assessments. The first, is your <strong>Writing Assignment #1</strong> - more information can be found on this assignment by scrolling down the page. The second assessment that will take place is <strong>Quiz #1</strong> - more information can be found by scrolling down the page.</p>
<p><em>Active participation in group exercises, reflection, and critical discourse is an essential component of this course. You are expected to show respect for all members of the course, both in your speech and actions. Contribute by actively observing and listening, raising thoughtful questions, examining relevant issues, building on others’ ideas, analyzing and evaluating the group’s thinking, synthesizing key points, and expanding the group’s perspectives. Take care not to dominate a conversation, giving space for others to speak. When in small groups help maintain the focus, flow, and quality of conversations, and take the initiative to invite others (particularly those who are quiet) to speak.</em></p>

<p><span class="blockhead">Writing Assignment #1</span></p>
<p>Your first assignment for the course will involve reading a formal research article and extracting important information. Research articles play an important role in psychology as they present new findings and research that help us better understand the subject field. It is, however, important for us to understand what information is important as we weigh the value of the article we are reading. This assignment attempts to help us better understand those considerations.</p>
<p>Your first task is to read <a href="assets/unit_4/Assessment_Empirical_Short.pdf"><strong>How to Read Empirical Articles</strong></a></p>
<p>As you can see, it is important to understand <strong><em>why</em></strong> you are reading an article and it is important to understand <strong><em>what</em></strong> you want to get out of it.</p>
<p>Next, your task is to read <a href="assets/unit_4/Assessment_Empirical_Long.pdf"><strong>How to Read a Journal Article in Social Psychology</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>This article should help support your understanding of formal research articles and how to read them to support your research and learning.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="blockhead">Writing Assignment</span></p>
<p>Finally, it is time to apply what we have learned. Download the following article:</p>
<p><a href="assets/unit_4/Assessment_FOMO_Article.pdf"><strong>No More FOMO</strong></a></p>
<!-- [plugin:content-inject](_alert)  -->
<p>After reading the article above, use the content to respond to the following questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Does this study reflect basic or applied research? How do you know?</strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong>What level(s) of analysis (biological, psychological, environmental) are being employed in this study? Explain and identify the specific details of the study that show this.</strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong>What were the findings of previous research that led the researchers to do this study? What was the research question that they attempted to answer? What was (were) the researchers’ hypothesis(es)?</strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong>How was this study conducted? Was it an experiment or a non-experiment? How can you tell? What were the variables under investigation in this study? Identify the dependent and independent variables, if applicable.</strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong>What were the main findings of this study? How do they relate to the original study hypothesis(es)?</strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong>How do the researchers explain their results? What are some other possible explanations? What are some strengths of this study? Limitations?</strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong>What are the possible implications of these results in the real world?</strong></li>
