[["index.html", "Introduction to Psychology Welcome Course Notes How this Course is Built", " Introduction to Psychology Todd Dutka Welcome This is the course book for [insert]. This book is divided into 6 units of study to help you engage with the materials. The course resources and learning activities are designed not only to help prepare you for the course assessments, but also to give you opportinities to practice various skills. Below you will find information about how to navigate this book. Please also refer the schedule in Moodle, as well as the Asseessment section in Moodle for instructions on required readings and assignments. Course Notes You should be reading this information in the context of a Trinity Western University course offered via Moodle. If this is not the case, then this may be an unauthorized reproduction of the course. Please contact elearning@twu.ca if you have concerns. These notes will be your guide through the learning activities and assessment strategies necessary for you to succeed in the course, so it is important for you to engage to the best of your ability and take advantage of the resources available to you through Trinity Western University. Assessment tasks are managed in other sections of the Moodle course, so be sure to familiarize yourself with those requirements and resources. How this Course is Built This course is primarily designed to be completed asynchronously, meaning that there are no scheduled times or places that you are required to meet, even online. You can work according to your own schedule within the six weeks you have to complete the course. That said, this is a full university level course and there are timelines that we strongly recommend that you meet to ensure that you are succeeding in building your knowledge through the course. It would be to your significant disadvantage to submit everything at the end of the course. Asynchronous courses require learners to be well-organized and self-motivated, and we have included supports for you to help you develop strong learning habits that will ensure your success. For example, there are several self-check quizzes throughout the course. These quizzes are not graded, but they can be powerful tools for you to ensure you understand key ideas and concepts. We suggest you take each quiz without the aid of your notes and textbook and multiple times until you have mastered the content. This strategy taps into three powerful learning structures that have been shown to be highly effective. Effortful recall. By intentionally trying to recall information without external aids, you are strengthening the neural pathways in your brain that lead to building new connections between ideas. One way to make recall easier is to connect key ideas to other things that you know or have experienced. For example, you might be studying World War II, and you connect the date that Canadians participated in the D-Day operation with something else meaningful to you that happened on June 6, like maybe the date you bought your first car. Spaced repetition. By spreading out your attempts on the quiz (leaving a few days between attempts) you can maximize the effects of the first strategy (effortful recall) and ensure that your second or third attempts truly reflect what you know about the topic. We suggest leaving 1-3 days between attempt 1 and 2, then 4-5 days between attempt 2 and 3. You can use a tool like Trello, Notion, or Asana (free versions), or even a task list on your phone to set up a spaced repetition schedule. Interleaving. This is the practice of studying a particular topic for a relatively short period of time (maybe 30-40 mins), then switching to a different topic for the same period, before going back to the original topic. We will help build this into your learning by including items from unit 1 in your unit 2-6 quizzes. You can also practice this by taking regular breaks in your work, or even by retaking a unit 1 quiz while you are working in unit 2. These three strategies are very effective at helping people remember key facts about a particular topic, an important first step in learning at the university level. However, you will be asked to do much more than just remember facts. Your ultimate goal is to develop evaluative judgement, or the ability for you to judge for yourself the quality of your (or your peers’) responses to prompts. The discussion forums are a key way for you to do this. We have set up the forums in such a way that you will need to present a response to any given prompt before you see other learners’ responses. We strongly encourage you to use this structure to formulate your own ideas before you present them in the forum, and then to use the responses of your peers to help you evaluate your own response. Using these self-check activities in this way is designed to help you to succeed on the course assignments, upon which your final grade will be determined. These assignments will require you to use the facts of the course to generate unique responses to the prompts, based on your past experiences, knowledge, and ability to evaluate the quality of your own work.

Course Units This course is organized into 6 units. Each unit of the course will provide you with the following information: A general overview of the key concepts that will be addressed during the unit. Specific learning outcomes and topics for the unit. Learning activities to help you engage with the concepts. These often include key readings, videos, and reflective prompts. The Assessment section provides details on assignments you will need to complete throughout the course to demonstrate your understanding of the course learning outcomes. Note that assessments, including assignments and discussion posts will be submitted in Moodle. See the Assessment tab in Moodle for the assignment dropboxes. Course Activities Below is some key information on features you will see throughout the course.  Learning Activity This box will prompt you to engage in course concepts, often by viewing resources and reflecting on your experience and/or learning. Most learning activities are ungraded and are designed to help prepare you for the assessment in this course.

While this review will be self-guided, it is critical that you understand the important elements that constitute valid and reliable scientific research as it is these methodologies that serve as the backbone for psychological studies. After taking time to review scientific research methodologies, we will turn our attention to the subject of Thought and Language. Developing an understanding of Thought and Language helps us better understand how we think, how we organize our thoughts and our knowledge of the world around us, and how we communicate and act out on this information. Topics This unit is divided into the following topics: Review- Scientific Research Thinking and Problem Solving Cognitive Biases Language and Thought Animal Language Learning Outcomes When you have completed this unit, you should be able to: Define key terminology related to principles of scientific research, research designs, and statistics. Explain the five characteristics of quality scientific research, and the pros and cons of descriptive, correlational, and experimental research designs. Determine how biases might influence the outcome of a study and how experiments help demonstrate cause-and-effect relationships. Apply the concepts of reliability and validity to examples and concepts of experimental methods to research examples. Assess whether anecdotes, authority figures, and common sense are reliably truthful sources of information. Understand what it means for variables to be positively or negatively correlated and how and why psychologists use significance tests.

Resources Here are some additional resources that will help you complete this unit: Krause, M., Corts, D., Smith, S. C., &amp; Dolderman, D. (2018). Revel for An Introduction to Psychological Science, 2nd Canadian Edition. Pearson Ed. Other resources will be provided online. 1.1 What is Psychology We begin our course with a quick challenge: In your own words, define “psychology.” According to your definition, how is psychology different from other academic areas that would study humans (for example, philosophy, literature, or history)? If you said “Pyschology is different because it uses the scientific method”- give yourself a pat on the back You will begin your study of the scientific method by reading your textbook. The parable below (from Philipchalk’s Social Psychology textbook), however, helps illustrate the scientific method with three “helpful” approaches to a problem, including a simple experiment: Once upon a time there were three brothers. One day while they were working in their father’s field, they saw an old man coming along the road. The old man greeted them, and then struggled on along the road, limping terribly. After that, every day at the same time, the brothers greeted the old man and watched as he hobbled by. When a month had passed, they were so impressed that they each did something. The first brother wrote a compelling story about perseverance in the face of the ravages of old age. It encouraged many people. The second brother painted a moving portrait of the old man, stooped over and limping along. People were inspired. The third brother, who had observed the old man very closely, asked him one day if he could exchange shoes with him. The old man was surprised, but he gladly agreed. When the old man walked away he did not limp. The next day the third brother gave the old man his shoes back and watched as he limped on his way. On the third day, the brother again exchanged shoes with the old man. Then he took the old man’s shoes to a shoemaker and had them repaired. When the brother gave them back to the old man he was delighted. The old man put on the shoes, thanked the brother, and walked away without a limp. Although each brother made a positive contribution, the third brother solved the man’s problem because he discovered its cause. To do this, he used the scientific method and he conducted an experiment (Philipchalk, 1994). I think psychology is one of the most interesting areas of study there is, first, because it studies people, people like you and me, and we’re interesting Second, I like psychology because it is so broad. Psychologists, as you will soon see, study everything from nerve conduction in single cells, all the way to the influence of groups on our behaviour—and everything in between. Finally, psychologists don’t just speculate and theorize, they look for evidence for their ideas. If they don’t find sufficient evidence, they change their ideas; and I like that. Which leads us back to the scientific method and how psychology began. Learning Activity Chapter 2 Review Quiz In order to review some of the major concepts from the text, take the following unmarked quiz. Although you will not be evaluated on these terms, they will assist you in the assignments for this course. 1.2 Thinking and Problem Solving Thinking “So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.” (Genesis 1:27) “I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.” (Psalm 139:14) The human image of God means many things. It seems that one aspect of this image is our thinking ability, including our ability to solve problems and speak. How important is our thinking ability in our reflection of God’s image? What does your answer mean for people with less ability? What about people who lose abilities due to accident or disease (e.g., Alzheimer’s patients)? Algorithms &amp; Heuristics Algorithms and heuristics can be confusing. An algorithm is a guaranteed route to a solution, but it may be the long way around to success. If you knew a person lived somewhere in a large residence hall, an algorithm for finding that individual would be to knock on every door until you located the person. Heuristics, on the other hand, sug­gest that you would first ask friends where to locate the person, or check a list, then knock on the appropriate door to locate the person. Another way to think of heuristics is the phrase “rule of thumb.” Can you think of some rules of thumb that you have learned from your various job experiences? They may have to do with how long to cook a hamburger, or when to refill a machine, or how to get a date. Consider the following example and explanation taken from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ron Philipchalk: In the second part of the book, they tell you how to crack a safe. There are all kinds of ninny-pinny, dopey things, like “It might be a good idea to try a date for the combination, because lots of people like to use dates.” Or “Think of the psychology of the owner of the safe, and what he might use for the combination.” And “The secretary is often worried that she might forget the combination of the safe, so she might write it down in one of the following places—along the edge of her desk drawer, on a list of names and addresses . . .” and so on . . . . I also did a certain amount of systematic study. For instance, a typical combination was 69-32-21. How far off could a number be when you’re opening the safe? If the number was 69, would 68 work? Would 67 work? On the particular locks we had, the answer was yes for both, but 66 wouldn’t work. You could be off by two in either direction. That meant you only had to try one out of five numbers, so you could try zero, five, ten, fifteen, and so on. With twenty such numbers on a wheel of 100, that was 8000 possibilities instead of the 1,000,000 you would get if you had to try every single number. . . . I practiced all the time on my own safe so I could do this process as fast as I could and not get lost in my mind as to which number I was pushing and mess up the first number. Like a guy who practices sleight of hand, I got it down to an absolute rhythm so I could try the 400 possible back numbers in less than half an hour. That meant I could open a safe in a maximum of eight hours—with an average time of four hours. (Surely You’re Joking Mr. Feynman, p. 140) Mr. Feynman’s safecracking system succeeds because he methodically works through every possible combination. By logical analysis he has discovered which 8,000 possibilities out of 1,000,000 he needs to try. We call this type of logical step-by-step procedure for solving problems an algorithm (Newell &amp; Simon, 1972; Simon, 1981). If you use the correct algorithm your success is guaranteed. But sometimes it can take a long time to discover the correct algorithm. And employing an algorithm is often time consuming. Mr. Feynman spent days developing his system and it took hours to open a safe. You could certainly open a safe much faster if you found the combination on the edge of the secretary’s drawer. The shortcuts Mr. Feynman calls “ninny-pinny, dopey things” are examples of heuristics. Heuristics are rule-of-thumb strategies for solving problems, shortcuts we develop from our experience. Heuristics often help us eliminate improbable alternatives and guide us to the most likely solution to a problem. Despite his appreciation for algorithms, Mr. Feynman discovered heuristics can be useful. He found, for example, that safe owners often did not bother to change the factory set combination when they received a new safe. In one office building the temporary factory combinations 25-0-25 or 50-25-50 opened one safe in five Algorithms and heuristics are examples of cognitive strategies—mental plans we use to make decisions and solve problems. Learning Activities Read and Reflect In addition to the content above, you are also responsible for reading through the following: Krause et. al (2018). Revel for An Introduction to Psychological Science, 2nd Canadian Edition. Chapter 8 While all of these pages may not relate directly to this unit’s discussion, consistent reading will help you keep pace, as well as provide necessary background knowledge when you need it. Problem Solving Activity In this lesson, we spent time exploring cognitive strategies used to solve problems and make decisions. We now have an opportunity to practice this on our own Take a look at the following problems and see if you can find a solution. As you work through the problems, think about what cognitive strategies you are implementing as you make each decision: Problem A Take a look at the following Roman Numeral: IX Now add one line to the Roman numeral IX to make it six Click here for the solution. The answer is to add a curved line shaped like an “S” (i.e., “SIX”). In writing, the problem looks simple, but you might want to try it aloud on a friend. There is a mental set that one must add a straight line and have some form of Roman numeral on the page. Problem B Your task is to plant trees on Arbor Day. You have ten trees that must be planted in five rows of four trees each. How would you plant the trees? Click here for the solution. The answer is that you would arrange them at the vertices and cross-points of a 5-pointed star Problem Solving Practice Below is a website that provides more opportunity to work through, and solve, some problems. Specifically, this resource explores the idea of Assumptions and the role assumptions play when solving problems. Furthermore, this is a valuable resource as it also explores other important techniques to be implemented when solving problems. Click on the following link and read through the information as you continue to practice your problem solving: Virtual Salt Learning Lab Preparation Your Learning Lab for this unit will focus on group discussion as explore the topics of this unit in more detail. As you prepare for your Learning Lab, one possible scenario that discussion will focus on is below- please prepare some thoughts to share with the group: In the largest sense, society is breaking into two classes: The first class are people who know how to think. These people realize that most problems are open to examination and creative solution. If a problem appears in the lives of these people, their intellectual training will quickly lead them to a solution or an alternative statement of the problem. These people are the source of the most important product in today’s economy – ideas. The second class, the vast majority of society, are people who cannot think for themselves. I call these people ‘idea consumers’ – metaphorically speaking, they wander around in a gigantic open-air mall of facts and ideas. The content of their experience is provided by television, the Internet and other shallow data pools. These people believe collecting images and facts makes them educated and competent, and all their experiences reinforce this belief. The central, organizing principle of this class is that ideas come from somewhere else, from magical persons, geniuses, ‘them.’ Consider the following prompts to help better prepare for the discussion: Do you agree or disagree with this claim? Do you know people that fit in the second category? What causes this difference? How might it be changed? 1.3 Cognitive Biases As if the biases mentioned in the textbook are not enough, here are a few more to watch out for, taken from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ron Philipchalk. The Gambler’s Fallacy Jill and Bob are the parents of three boys. Jill is pregnant again, and she and Bob are hoping the baby is a girl. In fact, they are confident the baby must be a girl because their previous three children were boys. If you agree with Jill and Bob that the baby is more likely to be a girl than a boy, then you—along with Jill and Bob—may be committing the gambler’s fallacy. No matter how many boys have been born, the likelihood of a girl being born is the same as it always was, approximately 50 % (assuming no biological abnormality or medical intervention). The gambler’s fallacy arises from our failure to recognize the independence of unconnected events. The result of a coin toss does not depend on the outcome of previous tosses; a child’s sex at conception is not affected by the sex of prior conceptions; the cards dealt in a hand are not influenced by the distribution of cards on the previous deal; and so on. Each event in these sequences is independent of the others, although we tend to think that somehow there must be a connection. The Anchoring and Adjustment Heuristic First impressions of a person exert a powerful influence on the way we interpret subsequent information about that person. This effect may be an example of a more general principle called the anchoring and adjustment heuristic. Information we use to establish a starting value (or anchor point) tends to be more influential in our decisions than subsequent information we use to adjust this value (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974). Daniel Cervone and his colleagues found, for example, that initial success or failure on a task can establish an anchor for feelings of self-efficacy. Students who initially succeed on a task and later fail have higher feelings of self-efficacy than students who initially fail and later succeed even though their overall level of success is the same. Final judgments of self-efficacy are biased in the direction of initial judgments (Cervone &amp; Palmer, 1990; Peake &amp; Cervone, 1989). Salespeople often use the anchoring and adjustment heuristic to their advantage. Some real estate agents routinely show their clients an over-priced and unattractive house first in order to set an anchor point which, in effect, says, “The kind of house you want is going to cost a lot.” Once established, this expectation of high price changes very slowly and the clients are relieved to find an acceptable house in their price range (Northcraft &amp; Neale, 1987). Car dealers too like us to set our sights high. Their so-called list price establishes an anchor or reference point that overshadows our subsequent evaluations, as I recently discovered. In looking for a certain model of car, I was attracted to a particular vehicle with an asking price of $3,800 (“reduced from $4,200”). I believed this price was too high, so I bargained with the vendor. Eventually, I bought the car for $2,800. Did the high original asking price affect my decision? Yes, it probably did. Subsequent events indicated I still paid too much. I later bought an identical model in only slightly poorer condition for $2,000. I was a victim of the anchoring and adjustment heuristic. Contrast Effects My car purchase also illustrates a related distortion in judgment, the contrast effect. In contrast to the original price of $4,200 my offer of $2,800 seemed like a bargain. John Lynch, Jr. and his colleagues (1991) found a similar effect with students. The students rated low-priced cars as less expensive when they were considered alongside high-priced cars (contrast effect), compared to when they were considered along with other low-priced cars (no contrast). Research by Douglass Kenrick and his colleagues indicates that we also show contrast effects in evaluating other people. In one study (1980), male college students rated the attractiveness of potential blind dates. Subjects who gave their ratings after watching a TV show with attractive female actresses rated the potential dates as less attractive than did subjects who rated their potential dates before watching the show. In another study (1989), after viewing centerfold erotica, men found average women—and even their own wives—less attractive. Heuristics &amp; Biases By now you may be wondering why we fall prey to so many cognitive biases and errors. Well don’t worry; our biases are actually a side effect of our cognitive efficiency. Most of our biases result from using heuristics, rules of thumb, or mental shortcuts that work very well. Sometimes they let us down, but overall, they improve the speed with which we handle mental problems—much like Mr. Feynman’s safe-cracking tricks. As we noted in the previous discussion, you could certainly open a safe much faster if you found the combination on the edge of the secretary’s drawer. However, you won’t always find the combination there, so limiting yourself to this approach would produce a kind of “cognitive bias” in your safe-cracking strategy.

In order to prepare for participation in this discussion, consider the guiding prompt below- be sure to have some thoughts to contribute to the discussion: Give an example from your own experience of one of the cognitive biases, discussed here or in the textbook, that you have fallen prey to. 1.4 Language and Thought Linguistic Relativity Benjamin Whorf’s linguistic relativity hypothesis suggests that our language affects the way we see the world. Do you know any examples of weather terms, for example, that are unique to one area? Could knowing these terms help you to notice differences in weather that outsiders might not notice? What about in sports? Sports fans usually know terms to de­scribe certain strokes or plays. Does knowledge of these terms affect percep­tion? Can you think of some examples? What does it mean to “clothesline” someone, or “post-up,” or “birdie?” Imaginary Practice Mental practice is now widely accepted in many areas. The following excerpt is taken from the GolfPsych website. You may find further examples there as well. “You can practice the mental aspects of your game anytime. We encourage our clients to do imagery practice of playing well in upcoming tournaments. This imaginary practice includes seeing the course, situation, doing a full mental pre-shot routine and seeing a good shot. You should also be feeling the way you do when you play your best. In addition, you should be practicing deep breathing and quieting your mind off-course. This is an extremely valuable tool that must be practiced to be effective. The mental game is much more than thinking positive thoughts. Take our Personality Assessment and get your own GolfPsych Report to receive our recommendations for you based on your personality and our research. Reading our book will also help you understand all aspects of a good mental game. During your practices and before your rounds you should also be practicing your mental skills.” Learning Activity Introduction to Visualization In this Topic, we learned about the notion of mental practice. Below is an article that will take you through the process of visualization. Take some time to read the article and practice for yourself. Pay careful attention to your thoughts, your focus, your feelings as you engage in the process. Introduction to Visualization Learning Lab Preparation The subject of our focus for this Topic has been on the power of language in influencing how we see the world. Our discussion during Learning Lab this week will focus on the importance of language in the Bible (and other religious writings) and how it “shapes” how we see the world. To prepare for this discussion, consider the following prompt: Give some examples of the importance of language in the Bible or other religious writings. 1.5 Animal Language Language As a Christian I am pleased to see in psychology the resurgence of interest in studying some of what Ronald Koteskey (1980) calls humanity’s “God-like” characteristics, creativity, imagery, and particularly language. The use of words is extremely important in Christian scripture. God spoke the creation into existence; Jesus is called the Word; the significance of Babel and Pentecost are closely linked to the importance of language; and there is great power associated with an individual’s name. In addition, Christians have usually considered the ability to communicate with words to be part of the image of God in man. However, recently several researchers claim to have taught animals, usually chimpanzees or apes, to communicate through language. Using sign language, blocks, or keyboards and computer- generated voices, the animals have signaled their needs and even generated word combinations. But is this truly language? There is no doubt that the animals are using symbols as signs to stand for objects and actions. However, there are significant questions being raised about the comparison with human language. Christians need to think carefully about what they mean when they talk about the image of God in man. The area of human learning and psycholinguistics offers some intriguing questions for thoughtful Christians. What is the origin of human speech-is it learned (as Skinner would say) or largely innate (as Chomsky would say)? Is human speech unique? Do the studies of language in animals necessitate a redefinition of the uniqueness of man? (Based on Psychology and Christianity by Ron Philipchalk, p. 102) RESOURCES: Online Articles of Interest To add to our exploration of this topic, take a moment to read the following articles: Chimp Talk Debate: Is It Really Language? Animal Language and Cognition Projects Learning Lab Preparation Finally, take a moment to consider the following questions: How important for our understanding of who we are as humans is the distinctiveness of our language ability? Is it a sign of the image of God? Be prepared to share your thoughts during discussion at your Learning Lab. Assessment While there is no “formal” assignment that you will be responsible for submitting for Unit 1, you will be expected to participate in discussion during your Learning Lab. Your facilitator will be providing a participation mark based on your contributions. Below is some information to consider prior to attending your Learning Lab: Active participation in group exercises, reflection, and critical discourse is an essential component of this course. You are expected to show respect for all members of the course, both in your speech and actions. Contribute by actively observing and listening, raising thoughtful questions, examining relevant issues, building on others’ ideas, analyzing and evaluating the group’s thinking, synthesizing key points, and expanding the group’s perspectives. Take care not to dominate a conversation, giving space for others to speak. When in small groups help maintain the focus, flow, and quality of conversations, and take the initiative to invite others (particularly those who are quiet) to speak.

Revel for An Introduction to Psychological Science, 2nd Canadian Edition. Pearson Ed. Other resources will be provided online. 2.1 What is Intelligence? Intelligence As David Myers points out, intelligence is a slippery concept. We all have an idea of what it refers to, but we cannot agree on a single definition. Perhaps the most helpful advice is to remember, as Myers points out, that “intelligence is a socially constructed concept. Cultures deem ‘intelligent’ whatever attributes enable success in those cultures” (2010). Historically, in North American culture, the idea of intelligence performance on an IQ test. The composition of these tests reflected North American culture’s emphasis on particular mental abilities, specifically, those associated with success in an academic setting. More recently, we have come to realize that there are many kinds of intelligence. In this unit we will consider some varieties of intelligence, or multiple intelligences. Types of Intelligence Emotional Intelligence I have to admit that when I first heard of emotional intelligence (EI) I was skeptical. It sounded like popular psychology - someone trying to make a buck preying on our need for self-knowledge. However, upon further investigation I found that EI was linked to social intelligence (the ability to understand and relate to people), a concept developed by the pioneering psychologist E.L. Thorndike in 1920. And upon still further investigation, I found EI made a lot of sense. 2.2 Sternberg’s Three Components of Intelligence Robert Sternberg wanted to show that intelligence was more than just one general ability (known as g theory). He believed our intelligence is best classified into three areas that predict real - world success: analytical, creative, and practical. The following article does a great job explaining the Triarchic Theory of Intelligence and its three sub-theories. It also makes note of the criticisms that have been brought against this theory. To better understand Sternberg’s Three Components of Intelligence follow the link below: Three Components of Intelligence 2.3 Gardner’s Eight Types of Intelligence Howard Gardner put together a robust, research-based theory of Multiple Intelligences. He put forth an understanding of intelligence promoting our abilities are best classified into nine independent intelligences, which include a broad range of skills beyond traditional school smarts. This illuminating read that can help you understand what your primary intelligences are. Follow the link below: Eight Types of Intelligence Resources: Online Articles of Interest To add to your exploration of this topic, take a moment to read the following articles: Emotional Intelligence Consortium Website EQI Web Resource Learning Activity Intelligence Testing In this unit we investigated Intelligence Testing. One of the important concepts we learned was that Intelligence Testing can be controversial due to its socially constructed nature. Below is a link to a website that will allow you to take some Intelligence Tests for yourself. As you work through each test, and see the results, think about why we might consider these types of tests beneficial, and why they might be considered controversial. Emotional Intelligence Test Learning Lab Preparation Our Learning Lab for this unit will focus on Intelligence Testing. As we have seen, Intelligence Testing is best implemented after careful consideration - this will be the focus of our discussion during this unit’s Learning Lab. To help you prepare, consider the following questions: How do you feel about the EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE TESTS? Did you learn anything? If so, what were the important areas that were illumined by the test? Is ‘emotional intelligence’ a valid concept worth measuring? Do you believe E-IQ is more important than “intelligence” as measured by IQ scores for success and happiness in your life?” 2.4 Extremes of Intelligence IQ Testing In this section we continue to build upon our understanding of intelligence and testing to focus on Intelligence tests and those who score at the “extremes.” Intelligence tests are the most common tool used to measure intelligence. Intelligence test are one method of assessing an individual’s mental aptitudes and comparing them with those of others using numerical scores. These scores are then plotted on a normal (bell) curve to estimate where a person’s intelligence rates in relation to a standardized population. The extremes of intelligence is the understanding that on one end of the continuum are those with intellectual disabilities and on the other end are those who are geniuses. Resources To supplement our understanding of this topic, take a moment to explore the following resources: The Arc MENSA International Learning Activity IQ Testing After considering the above, and having read the textbook’s discussion of intelligence testing, you might want to try some tests yourself. The value in doing this is not that you will get an accurate idea of your IQ score, but rather that you might get a better understanding for some of the problems in testing. As you try some of the tests at the following sites, remind yourself of the problems of test standardization, validity, and reliability. How well do you think these tests measure up? Queendom IQ Test davideck.com Learning Lab Preparation As we prepare for our Learning Lab this week, we consider intelligence from a Christian perspective. Read the following passage and carefully consider the questions below to help prepare for our discussion: The Bible says, in James; Chapter 2: My brothers, as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, don’t show favoritism. Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in. If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, “Here’s a good seat for you,” but say to the poor man, “You stand there” or “Sit on the floor by my feet,” have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts? Could we be guilty of favoritism in esteeming more intelligent people above less intelligent people? In society? In Church? 2.5 Nature-Nature and IQ While the debate rages over the relative contributions of nature and nurture to IQ, no one denies that heredity (nature) plays some role. The question arises then, “So what?” Are we going to try to control (and presumably increase) IQ through genetic engineering or some other method of eugenics (Eugenics is the search for hereditary factors that give people an evolutionary advantage; translated it can mean “good genes” or “good origin”)? Are we going to control who should have children and how many, allowing the most intelligent parents to have more children and restricting the less intelligent? When the genetic basis for IQ (or some other component of intelligence) is identified, will parents select embryos with greater potential? For more on this topic see the following quote and the website from which it came. “If we are concerned for the future of the (hopefully) millions of generations still to be born, we must realize that their fate lies to a considerable extent in the breeding practices of those who are currently alive.” (Intelligence and Eugenics) 2.6 What Will You Do? If or when you have children, will you ban screens (TV, smart phone, tablet, laptop) as a “brain rotter” and read to them every day? Or will you just let nature take its course and allow both screens and reading? 2.7 Test Biases? IQ tests are generally valid for their original purpose—as predictors of aca­demic performance. Controversy arises when IQ scores are taken to mean over­all intelligence and even overall worth. IQ scores consistently predict that some cultural and racial groups will do better at school than will other groups. These differ­ences are an indication of bias not in the IQ tests but in the back­grounds and academic settings that first create and then magnify differences.

Although you will not be evaluated on these terms, they will assist you in the assessments for this course: Learning Lab Preparation Consider the following scenario (and questions) as you continue to prepare for this unit’s Learning Lab. You will be asked to share your thoughts so come prepared *If you suggest that Asians have darker skin than Caucasians, you are not considered racist; this is an obvious fact with a genetic basis. However, if you suggest that Asians are more intelligent than Caucasians (as IQ tests show), or that African Americans are less intelligent, watch out What is different about these two claims that makes us accept one and not the other? Is it the role of nature versus nurture? Or is it more closely tied to the high value our culture places on intelligence, and especially IQ scores? If IQ were unimportant would it matter if one racial or gender group tended to score higher than another group? Would you be considered racist or sexist for suggesting this?

This rapid change continues throughout the first few years of life. Development during early life is clearly a function both of nature and of the environment. Questions to Consider After you have read the first few pages of this chapter you should be able to answer the following questions: How is the gender of an offspring determined? What differentiates zygotes from embryos and embryos from fetuses? (These questions are intended for personal reflection - you are not intended to submit anything for assessment) Designer Babies It is beginning to look inevitable that, however fierce the debate, the technology to make designer babies will happen - maybe just 20 years from now. Geneticists claim to have found the gene for good-parenting, genes for obesity, Alzheimer’s, red hair, and even happiness. Incredibly, scientists have even constructed an artificial human chromosome, which could carry any genes a geneticist - or prospective parents - desired. Embryo A technique called Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) is already being used to screen embryos for genetic diseases. Embryos created outside the body using in vitro fertilization are tested to see whether they carry a genetic disorder before being transferred to the uterus. It’s deeply controversial whether parents should ever be allowed to select embryos just because they’re genetically different. At the moment the technique is used for therapeutic purposes only, to screen for children who may have a deadly genetic disease. Even if some parents and their doctors were willing to use PGD for cosmetic or enhancement purposes, which remains absolutely taboo, the technique is limited in a crucial way - PGD can only select an embryo with genes inherited from the parents. Bottled Genes? One day parents may be able to pick any gene they desire from a range of bottled genes and have it put into their embryos. (quoted from “Designer Babies” website) Learning Activities Designer Babies This activity involves some reading and reflection around the topic of genetic engineering. As this is a contemporary issue, it will be valuable to familiarize yourself with some of the complexities of this technology and think critically about some of the ethical challenges. Your task is to read the following resources and carefully consider the implications of this technology: Editing the DNA of Embryos with CRISPR Designer Babies, CRISPR, &amp; Genetic Engineering Learning Lab Preparation Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following scenario and questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week’s Learning Lab: Modern techniques of conception and human genetic engineer­ing raise important new issues for human development. A pam­phlet containing the following message was left at doorsteps in TWU professor Philipchalk’s neighborhood: Image showing an example of surrogacy message (You may also wish to comment on the “Designer Babies” topic above.) How do you feel about this request? What problems might you anticipate? 3.2 Infancy and Childhood A Child’s View of God One evening on a camping trip several years ago, my wife and I listened outside the tent as our five-year-old Joelle and three-year-old Matthew tried to get to sleep. Always the “mother,” Joelle attempted to dispel her little brother’s fear of bears and other wild creatures by reminding him that Jesus was watching over them. Not content with generalities, Matt responded, “Does Jesus got a gun?” (Psychology and Christianity by Ronald Philipchalk, p. 141) As any Sunday School teacher knows, children see God differently from adults—often in very concrete terms (protection requires a gun!). Studying cognitive development can help us to understand as well as teach children at their own level. The Process of Cognitive Change Our textbook provides a good summary of the structure (stages) of cognitive development. The section, however, does not address the process by which a person moves from one stage to the next. Piaget believed that the key to cognitive development is something called cognitive conflict or cognitive disequilibrium. For cognitive development to proceed, the individual must constantly re-evaluate his or her schemas. According to Piaget, we develop schemas from an early age of life. Schemas are our cognitive representations of the world. Schemas help us to organize our experiences. They also allow us to make predictions about what outcomes might result from particular behaviours. Schemas are very important in helping us to understand and to adapt to the world. Although schemas are important in helping us to understand the world, they are not always accurate. People at all ages can have mental representations of the world that are not correct. Can you think of any examples of inaccurate schemas? Although people at all ages can have inaccurate mental representations of the world, children are especially prone to view the world in an incorrect way. The reason children may view the world in an incorrect way is because the structure of their cognitive processing is developing. Piaget believed that inaccurate schemas are changed only when they are challenged in the cognitive structure of the child. This challenge has been termed cognitive conflict. Basically, the process of cognitive change works as follows: People are motivated to maintain a state of cognitive equilibrium. When a child encounters information from the world and the information is inconsistent with his or her schema, the new piece of information creates a state of disequilibrium or cognitive conflict. Equilibrium may be restored through one of the two processes of adapation called assimilation and accommodation. Assimilation occurs when a child re-organizes the new information in such a way as to make the new piece of information consistent with his or her preexisting schema of the world. Accommodation occurs when a child alters his or her schema such that the new piece of information can now be incorporated into the new schema. Thus the process of accommodation produces the greatest cognitive change. Can you think of examples of both assimilation and accommodation? Here is an example: Equilibrium-Preexisting Schema: Child has grown up in an environment where all people he interacted with were of the same race (mom, dad, siblings, grandma, grandpa, etc.) Child has seen people of other racial groups, but has never interacted with them. Child develops the schema that people tend to like others who are of the same race as him or her. Cognitive Conflict Produced: At four years of age the child begins to attend preschool. At this time he starts to interact with children of various races. The child begins to develop a friendship with a child of a different race. This friendship creates cognitive conflict for the child: “How can I like someone who is a different color?” To resolve this cognitive conflict, the child has two options: Option A- Assimilation: In order to maintain his or her preexisting schema, the child re-organizes the information such that the other child is not perceived to be so dissimilar after all: “Maybe he is a different color from me, but we both speak English. We must not be so dissimilar after all.” Option B- Accommodation: The child’s preexisting schema is altered such that the new information can be incorporated into a new way of perceiving the world, “Maybe I can be friends with someone who is different from me.” Cognitive Equilibrium is Restored Although cognitive equilibrium is restored via either assimilation or accommodation, assimilation serves to maintain an inaccurate schema (that differences inhibit the development of friendships) whereas accommodation serves to produce cognitive change and hence produces a more accurate representation of the world (that differences do not inhibit the development of friendships).

If you can, give some examples from children you know…. Would children even have an idea of God if they were not taught it? 3.3 Adolescence John has just turned 13. Over the past year he has experienced may changes. He has grown over six inches and he has developed acne over his face and back. Not only is he changing physically, he is also experiencing a wave of emotional, spiritual, cognitive, and sexual changes. John has become self-focused and very self-critical. In addition, he is beginning to think abstractly and to challenge adults’ “dominion” on knowledge. John is also on a quest to understand “who he is” and “what his place is in the world”. John’s quest for an identity makes him more vulnerable to peer pressure and to the influence of radical groups and cults. During this time that we call adolescence, John will make many decisions that will have a profound effect on the direction his life will take. Does any of the above sound familiar? Before you begin reading the textbook section on adolescence, think back to your own adolescence. As you think about your experience of adolescence, use the following questions to guide your reflection: What physical changes did you experience in adolescence? How did these physical changes make you feel? In what ways did your view of the world change during adolescence? How did your way of treating other people change during adolescence? What was most important to you during adolescence? To what extent is “who you are today” a function of “who you became during adolescence”? No Adolescence? In other times and in other cultures to­day, adolescence does not exist as a significant and distinct period of develop­ment. This might seem surprising and difficult to imagine. Think of how modern society would be different, or if it could even exist, without a period of adolescence. What are the advantages and disadvantages of having an adolescent period? Identity The concept of identity is a rich topic for consideration. The most familiar aspect of identity is occupational identity, since much of “who we are” in our society rests on the kind of work we do. Perhaps you can readily relate to this in your choice of major. Less familiar, but equally important, is ideological identity. Ideologi­cal identity, including both religious and political orientations, may un­dergo a tremen­dous upheaval during your student years. Do you have the same political beliefs as your parents? What about religious beliefs? Conflict and questioning of parental beliefs and values may be a necessary part of establishing your personal iden­tity—even if the beliefs and values you ultimately adopt are the same as those of your parents. Learning Activities Read and Reflect In this section we explore adolescence and the changes in development we go through.

Revel for An Introduction to Psychological Science, 2nd Canadian Edition. Pearson Ed. Other resources will be provided online. 4.1 Adulthood Psychosocial Development There are many changes we experience during the time we call adulthood. According to Erikson’s theory of psychosocial development, adults move through three important stages during which they must resolve important psychosocial conflicts: Early Adulthood Middle Adulthood Late Adulthood In Early Adulthood (20-40 years of age) the psychosocial crisis is one of intimacy versus isolation. Although it is often perceived as critical whether or not the person develops an intimate relationship with a lifelong partner, Erikson believed that although this is one component of intimacy in this stage, other types of intimacy are also important—like developing intimate relationships with workmates, colleagues, and even one’s children. If one fails to develop a sense of intimacy during this stage, he or she will feel isolation. In Middle Adulthood (40-65 years of age) the psychosocial crises is one of generativity versus stagnation. What is generativity? Erikson used the term gererativity to describe the process by which a person feels like he or she is making a lasting contribution in the world. Usually, generativity involves giving something back to the next generation. People at this stage can feel generative in many ways—coaching a softball team, being a scout leader, teaching children in Sunday School, been a big brother/sister, etc. If a person fails to develop a sense of generativity during this stage, he or she will feel a sense of stagnation. In Late Adulthood (65+ years of age) the psychosocial crisis is one of ego integrity versus despair. If the individual looks back on his or her life and feels a sense of pride in the accomplishments he or she has made, then the individual will feel a sense of ego integrity. However, if the person looks back on his or her life and does not see the significance of his or her accomplishments, then he or she will feel a sense of despair at the meaninglessness of his or her life. Guilt One of the most significant developments in childhood, from both a secular and Christian point of view, is a conscience with its attendant guilt. Is guilt simply a conditioned emotional response (as the behaviorist might say)? Is it the result of conflict with the superego (as a psychoanalyst would say)? Is it the failure to live up to our self-concept (as the humanist might say)? Is it the voice of the Holy Spirit? Or is it some combination of these? (For help on this issue and an important distinction between false and true guilt see Counts and Narramore (1970), Narramore (1984), Tournier (1962).) (from Psychology and Christianity, by Ronald Philipchalk, p. 146) The textbook discusses moral development in childhood and adolescence. However, many adults are troubled by questions of right and wrong, and in particular, by feelings of guilt. The Christian authors noted above suggest that many guilt feelings are not true guilt but false guilt carried over from childhood experiences. Understanding how conscience and guilt feelings develop can help to liberate us from unnecessary false guilt inappropriately attributed to God. Learning Activities Read and Reflect This activity involves some reading and reflection around Erikson’s Eight Psychosocial Stages and an article from Harvard University illuminating the importance of relationships in healthy aging. Erik Erikson’s Stages of Social-Emotional Development Good Genes are Nice, but Joy is Better Learning Lab Preparation Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week’s Learning Lab: What do you hope to accomplish during your “adult development” years? (If you are past these years, what are you most pleased with?) 4.2 Death and Dying Death Secular psychologists see death as final. Christians, however, see resurrection beyond, with death being but another step in that direction. What implications do these beliefs have for the process of dying? As medical technology has advanced death has become more and more difficult to define. We need to focus our attention less on preserving the physical and more on preserving the personhood of the individual. This means giving greater attention to our concept of the dying person created in the image of God (as the abortion issue has forced us to do at the other end of life). When is personhood sacrificed to technical efficiency? Should we advocate a more “natural death?” What is “natural death?” How far does one go in “allowing” natural death? (from Psychology and Christianity, by Ronald Philipchalk, p. 146) Hospice You matter because of who you are. You matter to the last moment of your life, and we will do all we can not only to help you die peacefully, but also to live until you die.” (Dame Cicely Saunders) During the Crusades of the Middle Ages a hospice provided lodging for travelers: a place of refuge and comfort. So in 1967, when Dame Cicley Saunders opened a facility in London to provide care and comfort to dying people and their families, St. Christopher’s hospice was an appropriate name. (Courtesy of the Langley Hospice Society) If you would like to know more about the hospice movement in this area, you can contact the Langley Hospice Society at 604-530-1115. Cultural Variations The following issues are often subject to cul­tural variations: Adolescence is unknown in some cultures Adolescent struggles and conflict are much less in some cultures (e.g., ) Stage theories may not apply in other cultures Ageism, especially with regard to intellectual abilities, is reduced, unknown, or even reversed in some cultures where the wisdom of old age is venerated The “social clock” may be set differently in other cultures Attitudes toward death vary greatly between cultures 4.3 Assessment In addition to your participation in this unit’s Learning Lab, you will also be responsible for two formal assessments.

Research articles play an important role in psychology as they present new findings and research that help us better understand the subject field. It is, however, important for us to understand what information is important as we weigh the value of the article we are reading. This assignment attempts to help us better understand those considerations. Your first task is to read How to Read Empirical Articles As you can see, it is important to understand why you are reading an article and it is important to understand what you want to get out of it. Next, your task is to read How to Read a Journal Article in Social Psychology This article should help support your understanding of formal research articles and how to read them to support your research and learning. Writing Assignment Finally, it is time to apply what we have learned.

Revel for An Introduction to Psychological Science, 3rd Canadian Edition Review Unit 5- Slides CLICK HERE An Introduction to Psychological Science - Chapter 12 - Personality True or False? Freud believed that boys develop sexual desires for their mother when they are between 3 and 6 years of age. One of the most reliable and valid measures of personality is the Rorschach inkblot test. Dreams are disguised wish fulfillments that can be interpreted by skilled analysts. Psychologists generally agree that painful experiences commonly get pushed out of awareness and into the unconscious. Most Americans believe that self-esteem is very important for motivating a person to work hard and succeed. Personality differences among dogs are as evident and as consistently judged as personality differences among humans. Most people recognize that personality descriptions based on horoscopes are invalid. From a few minutes’ inspection of our living and working spaces, someone can, with reasonable accuracy, assess our emotional stability. Older people are happiest when they do not have to take responsibility for everyday decisions that affect their lives. The majority of people suffer from low self-esteem.

Read and Reflect This Learning Activity is an opportunity to explore dreams and birth order, two of the constructs that help shape and reflect who we are as individuals. Keep in mind, though, there are many different theories and interpretations on the role dreams and birth order play. The humanistic view, as it relates to personality, sees self-esteem as key ingredient for success in life. The articles in this activity illuminate how a healthy self-esteem can benefit personality development. It will also be helpful for preparation for discussion this week. In this activity you will have the opportunity to analyze the power of the environment in influencing your perceived options. The concepts of Learned Helplessness vs. Learned Optimism will be used to highlight how important environmental factors are. Practice, Read, and Reflect In this activity you will have the opportunity to take a personality test (from a list of options). I would encourage you to interact with the results and ponder whether or not you think the test is accurate or inaccurate and whether or not the information provided seems unique to you or could it be applied to anyone given the right situation. Key Terms Quiz Practice quiz to assess how well you know key terms from Chapter 12. Not for formal evaluation. Learning Lab Preparation Each topic will provide a question or scenario for you to consider prior to attending your Learning Lab. Be sure to carefully consider each prompt as you will be expected to contribute to the group discussion. Resources Here are some additional resources that will help you complete this unit: Krause, M., Corts, D., Smith, S. C., &amp; Dolderman, D. (2018). Revel for An Introduction to Psychological Science, 2nd Canadian Edition. Pearson Ed. Other resources will be provided online. 5.1 Psychoanalytic View “We are sent into this world to acquire a personality and a character to take with us that can never be taken from us.” (In a letter from a WW II Royal Air Force pilot to his mother) Personality Theories In this chapter we consider the topic of personality theories. In doing this we examine several major perspectives. Within each of these there are many variations (e.g., Adler, Jung, and Freud within the psychoanalytic perspective). If you would like to know more about this area, you might be interested in taking the course “Theories of Personality” (Psychology 301 at TWU). Aside from all these more formal theories, each of us has an implicit personality theory. This is our personal idea of what people are like, including which personality characteristics go together. For example, we think of people who are attractive and intelligent as likable rather than unlikable. Our socialization leads us to assume certain traits go together. As you go through this chapter, you may find some approaches are closer to your own assumptions (implicit theory), and you may prefer these approaches to others. You may also find your implicit theory becomes more explicit. Finally, you may even modify your own theory in the face of new information. Dreams “And afterward, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions” (Joel 2:28). God apparently spoke through dreams many times in the bible, and in Joel 2:28 He promised to do so in the future. Does God still (or again) speak through dreams? Are we missing out on a possible leading from God when we ignore our dreams? If you would like to read more on this subject you might be interested in books by Christians on this subject. For example, see John A. Sanford’s Dreams, God’s Forgotten Language, or Morton T. Kelsey’s God, Dreams, and Revelation, or Abraham Schmitt’s Before I Wake. The website below (cf. Online Resources) contains some balanced advice. Also, voice your opinion or give your experience in the online discussion. Birth Order You may be familiar with Adler’s concept of the family constellation, which implies that position in the family has a powerful effect on goals, self-concept, and ways of relating to others. As a test of this concept, think of a three-child family, all of whom were born within a few years (using larger families makes things too complicated). Try applying Adler’s theory to predict which child in the family is likely to be: the best student the most shy the most helpful around the house the most outgoing the “hell raiser” the most “helpless” the charmer the “baby” of the family You will not always be right—but neither was Adler. The important thing is to note that Adler made psychology aware of the different expectations and social influences on different children in the same family. In some respects, children in the same position in different families are more alike than are children in differ­ent positions in the same family Learning Activities Read and Reflect Having just introduced Personality Theories to the course, we begin to explore psychoanalytic views of human development. Dreams and birth order are but two of the constructs that help shape and reflect who we are as individuals- there are many different theories and interpretations on the role dreams and birth order play. Take a moment to consider the following articles: Christian Perspective on Dreams Birth Order and Your Personality Learning Lab Preparation Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week’s Learning Lab: Does God speak through dreams? What reasons do you have for your opinion? Can you give an example? 5.2 Humanistic View Self-Esteem In 1890, William James gave a simple formula for self-esteem: James explained: Such a fraction may be increased as well by diminishing the denominator as by increasing the numerator. To give up pretensions is as blessed a relief as to get them gratified; and where disappointment is incessant and the struggle unending, this is what men will always do. . . . How pleasant is the day we give up striving to be young—or slenderThank Godwe say, those illusions are gone. (James, 1890) (Quoted from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ron Philipchalk) In his textbook, David Myers discusses the pros and cons of promoting self-esteem. Consider also the following: Self-Esteem: A Contrary View Self-esteem is a popular topic in North American society and researchers have expended a vast amount of effort studying it. Approximately 10,000 studies have explored the possible relationship between self-esteem and various human problems (Scheff et al., 1989). The assumption that low self-esteem is at the root of many personal and social problems has reached the level of a cultural truism. The California legislature (1990) has even established a task force to promote self-esteem, believing that enhanced self-esteem is a vaccine against drug abuse, teen-age pregnancy, welfare dependency, and other social ills. Sharon Neuman (1992) suggests that the need to enhance self-esteem has become a “motherhood issue”—meaning that belief in its value is so widely accepted it goes unquestioned. Recently, however, several authors have begun to challenge this focus on raising self-esteem. They point out that high self-esteem can sometimes be detrimental, if, for example, it leads people to set inappropriate, risky goals that are beyond their capabilities (Baumeister, et al., 1993a). In addition, the relationship between self-esteem and other measures of well-being is often weak or nonexistent (Burr &amp; Christensen, 1992; Hermans, 1992; Jackson, 1984). Perhaps most importantly, high self-esteem may be the result and not the cause of other positive tendencies (Alexander &amp; Baker, 1992). Sharon Neuman (1992) argues that self-esteem must follow, not precede, real achievement. She claims that no number of self-esteem programs can replace the genuine satisfaction of a job well done. Wesley Burr and Clark Christensen (1992) suggest that the idea that we must esteem ourselves highly before we can value and love others is a “Western myth.” They add: We would improve our thinking if we were to take the idea that “we cannot love others until we love ourself” and turn it 180 degrees to be: “We cannot love ourself until we love others.” We would further improve our thinking if we then concluded that this is a fairly irrelevant and unimportant idea anyway because it still implies that loving ourself is what is important. (p. 464) Burr and Christensen suggest that self-esteem is a fruit and not a root of healthy emotional connections between people. (From Invitation to Social Psychology by Ron Philipchalk) 5.3 Christianity &amp; Humanism Some Christians object to the humanistic perspective because of its unqualified affirmation of human goodness and its apparent promotion of self-love. It is important to note, however, that humanistic psychology is not to be equated with the philosophy and social movement called humanism. Although it focuses on humans, so too do other approaches to personality. (The behavioral psychologist B.F. Skinner was a signatory to the Humanist Manifesto but a major opponent of humanistic psychology.) In his authoritative work on the history of psychology, Ernest Hilgard writes, “Humanistic psychology as something contemporary is not to be confused with other forms of humanism, such as humanistic studies which refer to classical or liberal arts topics, or that form of humanism which sets itself against theological beliefs (1987, p. 504). In fact, J.I. Packer and Thomas Howard in their book Christianity: The true humanism (1985) argue that only Christianity gives a valid basis for assuming humans have value. Learning Activities Read and Reflect As we explore a humanistic view, as it relates to personality, we start to see the development of self-esteem. This will be the focus of this unit’s Learning Lab. In order to prepare for discussion this week, take a moment to consider the following resources: Kids Health: Self Esteem National Association for Self-Esteem Society for Humanistic Psychology The purpose of these resources is to help you assess your self-esteem, help to build a healthy self-esteem, and to provide you with a credible site for learning more about Humanistic Psychology. Learning Lab Preparation Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week’s Learning Lab: If you wanted to study the psychologically healthiest individuals, whom would you study? How would you decide? 5.4 Trait View Trait Theory In the previous lesson we discussed implicit theories of personality. Many people’s implicit theories include elements of trait theory. They believe that personality is made up of traits. For example, popular ideas of leadership and success often rest on this assumption (e.g., Traits for success). Actually this view is quite old, going back to the ancient Greeks: Almost 2,000 years ago a Greek physician named Galen suggested that there were four basic types of personality, based on four different “humors,” or fluids, in the body. Galen called these personality types sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, and melancholic. When Eysenck combined his two basic personality scales, he found that he had a “less humorous” version of a classic theory. (from Understanding Human Behavior by Ron Philipchalk &amp; James McConnell) In psychology today there is a growing effort towards accurate measurement of personality traits, and investigation of the ways in which traits interact with the environment. One of the most popular applications of trait theory is in the prediction of employee success. After looking at the “Big 5,” which trait do you think is the most important? Imagine you own a business and you have to make a quick decision to hire one of 5 very similar applicants. The only trait measure you have is each applicant’s score on the “Big 5.” The only problem is that each one scores high on a different factor. Which one would you hire? Measuring Personality The trait approach to personality is closely linked to the matter of psychological testing. The strength of this approach is that it provides quantifiable data for analysis and comparison. The weakness is the difficulty in measuring traits accurately. Remember our discussion of standardization, validity, and reliability of intelligence tests? Personality tests must also meet the same criteria. (An additional problem is that our situations guide us as well as our traits.) This is an important point to remember when you encounter the many so-called personality tests in the popular media. Barnum Effect Do you have a desire to know what “kind” of person you are? This common desire can be used to manipulate you in a variety of ways. As discussed in the textbook, sometimes it is easier to make people believe that you are measuring their personality than it is to actually measure it. In fact, it is remarkably easy for people to be convinced that a personality profile describes them well. This phenomena is known as “the Barnum effect,” after the circus showman P. T. Barnum. The Barnum effect hearkens back to the late 1940s, when psychologist Bertram Forer gave research participants a personality test and then generated a personality description that subjects believed was based on their test responses. Even though all participants were given exactly the same personality description, they found the profile to be highly convincing and descriptive of them as an individual. When asked to rate how well the profile described them, on a scale ranging from 0 (very poor) to 5 (excellent), the average rating was an impressive 4.26 (Forer, 1949)You, too, can try this experiment. Read the personality description below and rate, on a scale ranging from 0 (very poor) to 5 (excellent), how well this description describes you: You have a strong need for other people to like you and for them to ad­mire you. You have a tendency to be critical of yourself. You have a great deal of unused energy which you have not turned to your advantage. While you have personality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them. Your sexual adjustment has presented some problems for you. Dis­ci­plined and controlled on the outside, you tend to be worrisome and in­se­cure inside. At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing. You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed-in by restrictions and limitations. You pride yourself as being an independent thinker and do not accept other opinions without satisfactory proof. You have found it un­wise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others. At times you are extro­verted, affable, sociable, while at other times you are introverted, wary, and reserved. Some of your aspirations tend to be pretty unrealistic. Learning Activities Practice, Read, and Reflect In this topic we have continued to develop our understanding of personality. This will be the focus of this unit’s Learning Lab. In order to prepare for discussion this week, take a moment to consider the following resource: Queendom.com Queendom.com is a great resource for different kinds of tests. You will be looking specifically at Personality tests on this site. When you go to www.queendom.com, click on the “TESTS, QUIZZES &amp; POLLS” tab and select TESTS. From the PERSONALITY TESTS list select ONE of the following personality tests: DISC Personality Test Big Five Personality Test Self-Control &amp; Self-Monitoring Test Happiness Test Locus Of Control &amp; Attributional Style Test Then interact with the results and ponder whether or not you think the test is accurate or inaccurate and whether or not the information provided seems unique to you or could it be applied to anyone given the right situation. Learning Lab Preparation Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week’s Learning Lab: What is the role of heredity in personality? Is our personality inherited and set for life? Can it be modified? Author Tim LaHaye has taken the Greek idea of types and body humors and adapted it to a Christian perspective incorporating the concept of spiritual gifts. Does the bible support an approach to personality that links individual differences to inherited traits? What is the role of the Holy Spirit in relationship to traits? - Are these different “gifts” (I Cor. 12)? Different “fruit (Gal 5:22)? Can they be changed? 5.5 Social-Cognitive View You + Your Environment Social-Cognitive Theory (SCT) was originally formulated by Albert Bandura at Stanford University. The fundamental premise of SCT is that models serve as the basis for learning new behaviours and that learning occurs in a social context with a dynamic and reciprocal interaction of the person, environment, and behavior; this is known as reciprocal determinism. Its emphasis is on external and internal social reinforcement and how these factors shape and maintain behavior in different environments. The theory also recognizes the influence of a person’s past experiences, which factor into whether behavioral action will occur. These past experiences serve as the primary reinforcements and expectancies, shaping whether or not a person will engage in a specific behavior and answering why a person engages in that behaviour. In summary, the Social-Cognitive view recognizes the mutual interdependence (“reciprocal determinism”) of individual qualities and situations. While we do have individual patterns of behaviour, we exhibit these according to the way we perceive our situation. Learning Activities Read and Reflect Who we are is, in large part, shaped by the environment in which live. This will be the focus of this unit’s Learning Lab. In order to prepare for discussion this week, take a moment to consider the following resources: Learned Helplessness Learned Optimism Test The above resources will help you to think about how your environment can impact your sense of agency (the ability to choose your behaviours to impact the environment) and how your sense of agency can influence your environment. This demonstrates the key idea of Social-Cognitive Theory, that you are in a constant, dynamic relationship with your environment and each factor is shaped by the other. Key Terms Quiz In order to review some of the major terms from Chapter 12 in your textbook, take the following unmarked quiz. Although you will not be evaluated on these terms, they will assist you in the assessments for this course: [h5p id=“81”] Learning Lab Preparation Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week’s Learning Lab: Research indicates that an internal locus of control is associated with more positive psychological outcomes than an external locus of control. Does this mean that Christians (and others who believe in God) are less psychologically healthy because they believe an external force (God) is in control? Assessment While there is no “formal” assignment that you will be responsible for submitting for Unit 5, you will be expected to participate in discussion during your Learning Lab. Your facilitator will be providing a participation mark based on your contributions. Below is some information to consider prior to attending your Learning Lab: Learning Lab Your facilitator will be providing a participation mark based on your contributions for this unit.
