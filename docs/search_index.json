[["index.html", "Introduction to Psychology 106 Welcome Course Notes How this Course is Built", " Introduction to Psychology 106 Todd Dutka Welcome This is the course book for PSYC 106. This book is divided into 6 units of study to help you engage with the materials. The course resources and learning activities are designed not only to help prepare you for the course assessments, but also to give you opportinities to practice various skills. Below you will find information about how to navigate this book. Please also refer the schedule in Moodle, as well as the Asseessment section in Moodle for instructions on required readings and assignments. Course Notes You should be reading this information in the context of a Trinity Western University course offered via Moodle. If this is not the case, then this may be an unauthorized reproduction of the course. Please contact elearning@twu.ca if you have concerns. These notes will be your guide through the learning activities and assessment strategies necessary for you to succeed in the course, so it is important for you to engage to the best of your ability and take advantage of the resources available to you through Trinity Western University. Assessment tasks are managed in other sections of the Moodle course, so be sure to familiarize yourself with those requirements and resources. How this Course is Built This course is primarily designed to be completed asynchronously, meaning that there are no scheduled times or places that you are required to meet, even online. You can work according to your own schedule within the six weeks you have to complete the course. That said, this is a full university level course and there are timelines that we strongly recommend that you meet to ensure that you are succeeding in building your knowledge through the course. It would be to your significant disadvantage to submit everything at the end of the course. Asynchronous courses require learners to be well-organized and self-motivated, and we have included supports for you to help you develop strong learning habits that will ensure your success. For example, there are several self-check quizzes throughout the course. These quizzes are not graded, but they can be powerful tools for you to ensure you understand key ideas and concepts. We suggest you take each quiz without the aid of your notes and textbook and multiple times until you have mastered the content. This strategy taps into three powerful learning structures that have been shown to be highly effective. Effortful recall. By intentionally trying to recall information without external aids, you are strengthening the neural pathways in your brain that lead to building new connections between ideas. One way to make recall easier is to connect key ideas to other things that you know or have experienced. For example, you might be studying World War II, and you connect the date that Canadians participated in the D-Day operation with something else meaningful to you that happened on June 6, like maybe the date you bought your first car. Spaced repetition. By spreading out your attempts on the quiz (leaving a few days between attempts) you can maximize the effects of the first strategy (effortful recall) and ensure that your second or third attempts truly reflect what you know about the topic. We suggest leaving 1-3 days between attempt 1 and 2, then 4-5 days between attempt 2 and 3. You can use a tool like Trello, Notion, or Asana (free versions), or even a task list on your phone to set up a spaced repetition schedule. Interleaving. This is the practice of studying a particular topic for a relatively short period of time (maybe 30-40 mins), then switching to a different topic for the same period, before going back to the original topic. We will help build this into your learning by including items from unit 1 in your unit 2-6 quizzes. You can also practice this by taking regular breaks in your work, or even by retaking a unit 1 quiz while you are working in unit 2. These three strategies are very effective at helping people remember key facts about a particular topic, an important first step in learning at the university level. However, you will be asked to do much more than just remember facts. Your ultimate goal is to develop evaluative judgement, or the ability for you to judge for yourself the quality of your (or your peers’) responses to prompts. The discussion forums are a key way for you to do this. We have set up the forums in such a way that you will need to present a response to any given prompt before you see other learners’ responses. We strongly encourage you to use this structure to formulate your own ideas before you present them in the forum, and then to use the responses of your peers to help you evaluate your own response. Using these self-check activities in this way is designed to help you to succeed on the course assignments, upon which your final grade will be determined. These assignments will require you to use the facts of the course to generate unique responses to the prompts, based on your past experiences, knowledge, and ability to evaluate the quality of your own work.

While this review will be self-guided, it is critical that you understand the important elements that constitute valid and reliable scientific research as it is these methodologies that serve as the backbone for psychological studies. After taking time to review scientific research methodologies, we will turn our attention to the subject of Thought and Language. Developing an understanding of Thought and Language helps us better understand how we think, how we organize our thoughts and our knowledge of the world around us, and how we communicate and act out on this information. Topics This unit is divided into the following topics: Review- Scientific Research Thinking and Problem Solving Cognitive Biases Language and Thought Animal Language Learning Outcomes When you have completed this unit, you should be able to: Define key terminology related to principles of scientific research, research designs, and statistics. Explain the five characteristics of quality scientific research, and the pros and cons of descriptive, correlational, and experimental research designs. Determine how biases might influence the outcome of a study and how experiments help demonstrate cause-and-effect relationships. Apply the concepts of reliability and validity to examples and concepts of experimental methods to research examples. Assess whether anecdotes, authority figures, and common sense are reliably truthful sources of information. Understand what it means for variables to be positively or negatively correlated and how and why psychologists use significance tests.

Other resources will be provided online. 1.1 What is Psychology We begin our course with a quick challenge: In your own words, define “psychology.” According to your definition, how is psychology different from other academic areas that would study humans (for example, philosophy, literature, or history)? If you said “Pyschology is different because it uses the scientific method”- give yourself a pat on the back You will begin your study of the scientific method by reading your textbook. The parable below (from Philipchalk’s Social Psychology textbook), however, helps illustrate the scientific method with three “helpful” approaches to a problem, including a simple experiment: Once upon a time there were three brothers. One day while they were working in their father’s field, they saw an old man coming along the road. The old man greeted them, and then struggled on along the road, limping terribly. After that, every day at the same time, the brothers greeted the old man and watched as he hobbled by. When a month had passed, they were so impressed that they each did something. The first brother wrote a compelling story about perseverance in the face of the ravages of old age. It encouraged many people. The second brother painted a moving portrait of the old man, stooped over and limping along. People were inspired. The third brother, who had observed the old man very closely, asked him one day if he could exchange shoes with him. The old man was surprised, but he gladly agreed. When the old man walked away he did not limp. The next day the third brother gave the old man his shoes back and watched as he limped on his way. On the third day, the brother again exchanged shoes with the old man. Then he took the old man’s shoes to a shoemaker and had them repaired. When the brother gave them back to the old man he was delighted. The old man put on the shoes, thanked the brother, and walked away without a limp. Although each brother made a positive contribution, the third brother solved the man’s problem because he discovered its cause. To do this, he used the scientific method and he conducted an experiment (Philipchalk, 1994). I think psychology is one of the most interesting areas of study there is, first, because it studies people, people like you and me, and we’re interesting Second, I like psychology because it is so broad. Psychologists, as you will soon see, study everything from nerve conduction in single cells, all the way to the influence of groups on our behaviour—and everything in between. Finally, psychologists don’t just speculate and theorize, they look for evidence for their ideas. If they don’t find sufficient evidence, they change their ideas; and I like that. Which leads us back to the scientific method and how psychology began. Learning Activity: Chapter 2 Review Quiz In order to review some of the major concepts from the text, take the following unmarked quiz. Although you will not be evaluated on these terms, they will assist you in the assignments for this course. 1.2 Thinking and Problem Solving Thinking “So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.” (Genesis 1:27) “I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.” (Psalm 139:14) The human image of God means many things. It seems that one aspect of this image is our thinking ability, including our ability to solve problems and speak. How important is our thinking ability in our reflection of God’s image? What does your answer mean for people with less ability? What about people who lose abilities due to accident or disease (e.g., Alzheimer’s patients)? Algorithms &amp; Heuristics Algorithms and heuristics can be confusing. An algorithm is a guaranteed route to a solution, but it may be the long way around to success. If you knew a person lived somewhere in a large residence hall, an algorithm for finding that individual would be to knock on every door until you located the person. Heuristics, on the other hand, sug­gest that you would first ask friends where to locate the person, or check a list, then knock on the appropriate door to locate the person. Another way to think of heuristics is the phrase “rule of thumb.” Can you think of some rules of thumb that you have learned from your various job experiences? They may have to do with how long to cook a hamburger, or when to refill a machine, or how to get a date. Consider the following example and explanation taken from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ron Philipchalk: In the second part of the book, they tell you how to crack a safe. There are all kinds of ninny-pinny, dopey things, like “It might be a good idea to try a date for the combination, because lots of people like to use dates.” Or “Think of the psychology of the owner of the safe, and what he might use for the combination.” And “The secretary is often worried that she might forget the combination of the safe, so she might write it down in one of the following places—along the edge of her desk drawer, on a list of names and addresses . . .” and so on . . . . I also did a certain amount of systematic study. For instance, a typical combination was 69-32-21. How far off could a number be when you’re opening the safe? If the number was 69, would 68 work? Would 67 work? On the particular locks we had, the answer was yes for both, but 66 wouldn’t work. You could be off by two in either direction. That meant you only had to try one out of five numbers, so you could try zero, five, ten, fifteen, and so on. With twenty such numbers on a wheel of 100, that was 8000 possibilities instead of the 1,000,000 you would get if you had to try every single number. . . . I practiced all the time on my own safe so I could do this process as fast as I could and not get lost in my mind as to which number I was pushing and mess up the first number. Like a guy who practices sleight of hand, I got it down to an absolute rhythm so I could try the 400 possible back numbers in less than half an hour. That meant I could open a safe in a maximum of eight hours—with an average time of four hours. (Surely You’re Joking Mr. Feynman, p. 140) Mr. Feynman’s safecracking system succeeds because he methodically works through every possible combination. By logical analysis he has discovered which 8,000 possibilities out of 1,000,000 he needs to try. We call this type of logical step-by-step procedure for solving problems an algorithm (Newell &amp; Simon, 1972; Simon, 1981). If you use the correct algorithm your success is guaranteed. But sometimes it can take a long time to discover the correct algorithm. And employing an algorithm is often time consuming. Mr. Feynman spent days developing his system and it took hours to open a safe. You could certainly open a safe much faster if you found the combination on the edge of the secretary’s drawer. The shortcuts Mr. Feynman calls “ninny-pinny, dopey things” are examples of heuristics. Heuristics are rule-of-thumb strategies for solving problems, shortcuts we develop from our experience. Heuristics often help us eliminate improbable alternatives and guide us to the most likely solution to a problem. Despite his appreciation for algorithms, Mr. Feynman discovered heuristics can be useful. He found, for example, that safe owners often did not bother to change the factory set combination when they received a new safe. In one office building the temporary factory combinations 25-0-25 or 50-25-50 opened one safe in five Algorithms and heuristics are examples of cognitive strategies—mental plans we use to make decisions and solve problems. Activity: Read and Reflect Read Chapter 8 from your text and review the notes. Activity: Problem Solving Activities In this lesson, we spent time exploring cognitive strategies used to solve problems and make decisions. We now have an opportunity to practice this on our own Take a look at the following problems and see if you can find a solution. As you work through the problems, think about what cognitive strategies you are implementing as you make each decision: Problem Solving Practice Below is a website that provides more opportunity to work through, and solve, some problems. Specifically, this resource explores the idea of Assumptions and the role assumptions play when solving problems. Furthermore, this is a valuable resource as it also explores other important techniques to be implemented when solving problems. Click on the following link and read through the information as you continue to practice your problem solving: Virtual Salt Activity: Questions for Consideration Read the following and consider the questions below: In the largest sense, society is breaking into two classes: The first class are people who know how to think. These people realize that most problems are open to examination and creative solution. If a problem appears in the lives of these people, their intellectual training will quickly lead them to a solution or an alternative statement of the problem. These people are the source of the most important product in today’s economy-ideas. The second class, the vast majority of society, are people who cannot think for themselves. I call these people ‘idea consumers’ – metaphorically speaking, they wander around in a gigantic open-air mall of facts and ideas. The content of their experience is provided by television, the Internet and other shallow data pools. These people believe collecting images and facts makes them educated and competent, and all their experiences reinforce this belief. The central, organizing principle of this class is that ideas come from somewhere else, from magical persons, geniuses, ‘them.’ Do you agree or disagree with this claim? Do you know people that fit in the second category? What causes this difference? How might it be changed? Be prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class 1.3 Cognitive Biases As if the biases mentioned in the textbook are not enough, here are a few more to watch out for, taken from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ron Philipchalk. The Gambler’s Fallacy Jill and Bob are the parents of three boys. Jill is pregnant again, and she and Bob are hoping the baby is a girl. In fact, they are confident the baby must be a girl because their previous three children were boys. If you agree with Jill and Bob that the baby is more likely to be a girl than a boy, then you—along with Jill and Bob—may be committing the gambler’s fallacy. No matter how many boys have been born, the likelihood of a girl being born is the same as it always was, approximately 50 % (assuming no biological abnormality or medical intervention). The gambler’s fallacy arises from our failure to recognize the independence of unconnected events. The result of a coin toss does not depend on the outcome of previous tosses; a child’s sex at conception is not affected by the sex of prior conceptions; the cards dealt in a hand are not influenced by the distribution of cards on the previous deal; and so on. Each event in these sequences is independent of the others, although we tend to think that somehow there must be a connection. The Anchoring and Adjustment Heuristic First impressions of a person exert a powerful influence on the way we interpret subsequent information about that person. This effect may be an example of a more general principle called the anchoring and adjustment heuristic. Information we use to establish a starting value (or anchor point) tends to be more influential in our decisions than subsequent information we use to adjust this value (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974). Daniel Cervone and his colleagues found, for example, that initial success or failure on a task can establish an anchor for feelings of self-efficacy. Students who initially succeed on a task and later fail have higher feelings of self-efficacy than students who initially fail and later succeed even though their overall level of success is the same. Final judgments of self-efficacy are biased in the direction of initial judgments (Cervone &amp; Palmer, 1990; Peake &amp; Cervone, 1989). Salespeople often use the anchoring and adjustment heuristic to their advantage. Some real estate agents routinely show their clients an over-priced and unattractive house first in order to set an anchor point which, in effect, says, “The kind of house you want is going to cost a lot.” Once established, this expectation of high price changes very slowly and the clients are relieved to find an acceptable house in their price range (Northcraft &amp; Neale, 1987). Car dealers too like us to set our sights high. Their so-called list price establishes an anchor or reference point that overshadows our subsequent evaluations, as I recently discovered. In looking for a certain model of car, I was attracted to a particular vehicle with an asking price of $3,800 (“reduced from $4,200”). I believed this price was too high, so I bargained with the vendor. Eventually, I bought the car for $2,800. Did the high original asking price affect my decision? Yes, it probably did. Subsequent events indicated I still paid too much. I later bought an identical model in only slightly poorer condition for $2,000. I was a victim of the anchoring and adjustment heuristic. Contrast Effects My car purchase also illustrates a related distortion in judgment, the contrast effect. In contrast to the original price of $4,200 my offer of $2,800 seemed like a bargain. John Lynch, Jr. and his colleagues (1991) found a similar effect with students. The students rated low-priced cars as less expensive when they were considered alongside high-priced cars (contrast effect), compared to when they were considered along with other low-priced cars (no contrast). Research by Douglass Kenrick and his colleagues indicates that we also show contrast effects in evaluating other people. In one study (1980), male college students rated the attractiveness of potential blind dates. Subjects who gave their ratings after watching a TV show with attractive female actresses rated the potential dates as less attractive than did subjects who rated their potential dates before watching the show. In another study (1989), after viewing centerfold erotica, men found average women—and even their own wives—less attractive. Heuristics &amp; Biases By now you may be wondering why we fall prey to so many cognitive biases and errors. Well don’t worry; our biases are actually a side effect of our cognitive efficiency. Most of our biases result from using heuristics, rules of thumb, or mental shortcuts that work very well. Sometimes they let us down, but overall, they improve the speed with which we handle mental problems—much like Mr. Feynman’s safe-cracking tricks. As we noted in the previous discussion, you could certainly open a safe much faster if you found the combination on the edge of the secretary’s drawer. However, you won’t always find the combination there, so limiting yourself to this approach would produce a kind of “cognitive bias” in your safe-cracking strategy.

Be prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class 1.4 Language and Thought Linguistic Relativity Benjamin Whorf’s linguistic relativity hypothesis suggests that our language affects the way we see the world. Do you know any examples of weather terms, for example, that are unique to one area? Could knowing these terms help you to notice differences in weather that outsiders might not notice? What about in sports? Sports fans usually know terms to de­scribe certain strokes or plays. Does knowledge of these terms affect percep­tion? Can you think of some examples? What does it mean to “clothesline” someone, or “post-up,” or “birdie?” Imaginary Practice Mental practice is now widely accepted in many areas. The following excerpt is taken from the GolfPsych website. You may find further examples there as well. “You can practice the mental aspects of your game anytime. We encourage our clients to do imagery practice of playing well in upcoming tournaments. This imaginary practice includes seeing the course, situation, doing a full mental pre-shot routine and seeing a good shot. You should also be feeling the way you do when you play your best. In addition, you should be practicing deep breathing and quieting your mind off-course. This is an extremely valuable tool that must be practiced to be effective. The mental game is much more than thinking positive thoughts. Take our Personality Assessment and get your own GolfPsych Report to receive our recommendations for you based on your personality and our research. Reading our book will also help you understand all aspects of a good mental game. During your practices and before your rounds you should also be practicing your mental skills.” Activity: Introduction to Visualization In this Topic, we learned about the notion of mental practice. Below is an article that will take you through the process of visualization. Take some time to read the article and practice for yourself. Pay careful attention to your thoughts, your focus, your feelings as you engage in the process. Introduction to Visualization Activity: Question for Consideration The subject of our focus for this section has been on the power of language in influencing how we see the world. In this activity, you are asked to focus on the importance of language in the Bible (and other religious writings) and how it “shapes” how we see the world. Carefully consider the following question: Give some examples of the importance of language in the Bible or other religious writings. Be prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class 1.5 Animal Language Language As a Christian I am pleased to see in psychology the resurgence of interest in studying some of what Ronald Koteskey (1980) calls humanity’s “God-like” characteristics, creativity, imagery, and particularly language. The use of words is extremely important in Christian scripture. God spoke the creation into existence; Jesus is called the Word; the significance of Babel and Pentecost are closely linked to the importance of language; and there is great power associated with an individual’s name. In addition, Christians have usually considered the ability to communicate with words to be part of the image of God in man. However, recently several researchers claim to have taught animals, usually chimpanzees or apes, to communicate through language. Using sign language, blocks, or keyboards and computer- generated voices, the animals have signaled their needs and even generated word combinations. But is this truly language? There is no doubt that the animals are using symbols as signs to stand for objects and actions. However, there are significant questions being raised about the comparison with human language. Christians need to think carefully about what they mean when they talk about the image of God in man. The area of human learning and psycholinguistics offers some intriguing questions for thoughtful Christians. What is the origin of human speech-is it learned (as Skinner would say) or largely innate (as Chomsky would say)? Is human speech unique? Do the studies of language in animals necessitate a redefinition of the uniqueness of man? (Based on Psychology and Christianity by Ron Philipchalk, p. 102) Online Articles of Interest To add to our exploration of this topic, take a moment to read the following articles: Chimp Talk Debate: Is It Really Language? Animal Language and Cognition Projects Activity: Questions for Consideration Take a moment to consider the following questions: How important for our understanding of who we are as humans is the distinctiveness of our language ability? Is it a sign of the image of God?

Revel for An Introduction to Psychological Science, 4th Canadian Edition. Pearson Ed. Other resources will be provided online. 2.1 What is Intelligence? Intelligence As David Myers points out, intelligence is a slippery concept. We all have an idea of what it refers to, but we cannot agree on a single definition. Perhaps the most helpful advice is to remember, as Myers points out, that “intelligence is a socially constructed concept. Cultures deem ‘intelligent’ whatever attributes enable success in those cultures” (2010). Historically, in North American culture, the idea of intelligence performance on an IQ test. The composition of these tests reflected North American culture’s emphasis on particular mental abilities, specifically, those associated with success in an academic setting. More recently, we have come to realize that there are many kinds of intelligence. In this unit we will consider some varieties of intelligence, or multiple intelligences. Types of Intelligence Emotional Intelligence I have to admit that when I first heard of emotional intelligence (EI) I was skeptical. It sounded like popular psychology - someone trying to make a buck preying on our need for self-knowledge. However, upon further investigation I found that EI was linked to social intelligence (the ability to understand and relate to people), a concept developed by the pioneering psychologist E.L. Thorndike in 1920. And upon still further investigation, I found EI made a lot of sense. Sternberg’s Three Components of Intelligence Robert Sternberg wanted to show that intelligence was more than just one general ability (known as g theory). He believed our intelligence is best classified into three areas that predict real - world success: analytical, creative, and practical. The following article does a great job explaining the Triarchic Theory of Intelligence and its three sub-theories. It also makes note of the criticisms that have been brought against this theory. To better understand Sternberg’s Three Components of Intelligence follow the link below: Three Components of Intelligence Howard Gardner’s Nine Types of Intelligence Howard Gardner put together a robust, research-based theory of Multiple Intelligences. He put forth an understanding of intelligence promoting our abilities are best classified into nine independent intelligences, which include a broad range of skills beyond traditional school smarts. This illuminating read that can help you understand what your primary intelligences are. Follow the link below: Theory of Multiple Intelligences Activity: Read and Learn To add to your exploration of this topic, take a moment to read the following articles: Emotional Intelligence Consortium Website EQI Web Resource Consider how these articles connect to what you have learned in this section. Activity: Intelligence Testing In this section we examined Intelligence Testing. One of the important concepts we learned was that Intelligence Testing can be controversial due to its socially constructed nature. Below is a link to a website that will allow you to take some Intelligence Tests for yourself. As you work through each test, and see the results, think about why we might consider these types of tests beneficial, and why they might be considered controversial. Emotional Intelligence Test Activity: Questions for Consideration This section focused on Intelligence Testing. As we have seen, Intelligence Testing is best implemented after careful consideration. Take a moment to reflect on the following questions: How do you feel about the EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE TESTS? Did you learn anything? If so, what were the important areas that were illuminated by the test? Is ‘emotional intelligence’ a valid concept worth measuring? Do you believe E-IQ is more important than “intelligence” as measured by IQ scores for success and happiness in your life?” Be prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class 2.2 Extremes of Intelligence IQ Testing In this section we continue to build upon our understanding of intelligence and testing to focus on Intelligence tests and those who score at the “extremes.” Intelligence tests are the most common tool used to measure intelligence. Intelligence test are one method of assessing an individual’s mental aptitudes and comparing them with those of others using numerical scores. These scores are then plotted on a normal (bell) curve to estimate where a person’s intelligence rates in relation to a standardized population. The extremes of intelligence is the understanding that on one end of the continuum are those with intellectual disabilities and on the other end are those who are geniuses.

The value in doing this is not that you will get an accurate idea of your IQ score, but rather that you might get a better understanding for some of the problems in testing. As you try some of the tests at the following sites, remind yourself of the problems of test standardization, validity, and reliability. How well do you think these tests measure up? Queendom IQ Test Mensa IQ Challenge Activity: Question for Consideration Take a moment to reflect on intelligence from a Christian perspective. Read the following passage and carefully consider the questions below to help prepare for our discussion: The Bible says, in James; Chapter 2: My brothers, as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, don’t show favoritism. Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in. If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, “Here’s a good seat for you,” but say to the poor man, “You stand there” or “Sit on the floor by my feet,” have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts? Could we be guilty of favoritism in esteeming more intelligent people above less intelligent people? In society? In Church? Be prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class 2.3 Nature-Nature and IQ While the debate rages over the relative contributions of nature and nurture to IQ, no one denies that heredity (nature) plays some role. The question arises then, “So what?” Are we going to try to control (and presumably increase) IQ through genetic engineering or some other method of eugenics (Eugenics is the search for hereditary factors that give people an evolutionary advantage; translated it can mean “good genes” or “good origin”)? Are we going to control who should have children and how many, allowing the most intelligent parents to have more children and restricting the less intelligent? When the genetic basis for IQ (or some other component of intelligence) is identified, will parents select embryos with greater potential? For more on this topic see the following quote and the website from which it came. “If we are concerned for the future of the (hopefully) millions of generations still to be born, we must realize that their fate lies to a considerable extent in the breeding practices of those who are currently alive.” (Intelligence and Eugenics) What Will You Do? If or when you have children, will you ban screens (TV, smart phone, tablet, laptop) as a “brain rotter” and read to them every day? Or will you just let nature take its course and allow both screens and reading? Test Biases? IQ tests are generally valid for their original purpose—as predictors of academic performance. Controversy arises when IQ scores are taken to mean overall intelligence and even overall worth. IQ scores consistently predict that some cultural and racial groups will do better at school than will other groups. These differences are an indication of bias not in the IQ tests but in the backgrounds and academic settings that first create and then magnify differences.

However, if you suggest that Asians are more intelligent than Caucasians (as IQ tests show), or that African Americans are less intelligent, watch out What is different about these two claims that makes us accept one and not the other? Is it the role of nature versus nurture? Or is it more closely tied to the high value our culture places on intelligence, and especially IQ scores? If IQ were unimportant would it matter if one racial or gender group tended to score higher than another group? Would you be considered racist or sexist for suggesting this?

This rapid change continues throughout the first few years of life. Development during early life is clearly a function both of nature and of the environment. Activity: Questions to Consider After you have read the first few pages of this chapter you should be able to answer the following questions: How is the gender of an offspring determined? What differentiates zygotes from embryos and embryos from fetuses? (These questions are intended for personal reflection - you are not intended to submit anything for assessment - but be prepared to share your thoughts with other members of the class Designer Babies It is beginning to look inevitable that, however fierce the debate, the technology to make designer babies will happen - maybe just 20 years from now. Geneticists claim to have found the gene for good-parenting, genes for obesity, Alzheimer’s, red hair, and even happiness. Incredibly, scientists have even constructed an artificial human chromosome, which could carry any genes a geneticist - or prospective parents - desired. Embryo A technique called Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) is already being used to screen embryos for genetic diseases. Embryos created outside the body using in vitro fertilization are tested to see whether they carry a genetic disorder before being transferred to the uterus. It’s deeply controversial whether parents should ever be allowed to select embryos just because they’re genetically different. At the moment the technique is used for therapeutic purposes only, to screen for children who may have a deadly genetic disease. Even if some parents and their doctors were willing to use PGD for cosmetic or enhancement purposes, which remains absolutely taboo, the technique is limited in a crucial way - PGD can only select an embryo with genes inherited from the parents. Bottled Genes? One day parents may be able to pick any gene they desire from a range of bottled genes and have it put into their embryos. (quoted from “Designer Babies” website) Activity: Designer Babies This activity involves some reading and reflection around the topic of genetic engineering. As this is a contemporary issue, it will be valuable to familiarize yourself with some of the complexities of this technology and think critically about some of the ethical challenges. Your task is to read the following resources and carefully consider the implications of this technology: Editing the DNA of Embryos with CRISPR Designer Babies, CRISPR, &amp; Genetic Engineering Activity: Questions for Consideration Take some time to think about the following scenario and questions before you move on: Modern techniques of conception and human genetic engineering raise important new issues for human development. A pamphlet containing the following message was left at doorsteps in TWU professor Philipchalk’s neighborhood: Image showing an example of surrogacy message (You may also wish to consider how the “Designer Babies” topic connects to this activity as well.) How do you feel about this request? What problems might you anticipate? Be prepared to share your thoughts with other members of the class 3.2 Infancy and Childhood A Child’s View of God One evening on a camping trip several years ago, my wife and I listened outside the tent as our five-year-old Joelle and three-year-old Matthew tried to get to sleep. Always the “mother,” Joelle attempted to dispel her little brother’s fear of bears and other wild creatures by reminding him that Jesus was watching over them. Not content with generalities, Matt responded, “Does Jesus got a gun?” (Psychology and Christianity by Ronald Philipchalk, p. 141) As any Sunday School teacher knows, children see God differently from adults—often in very concrete terms (protection requires a gun!). Studying cognitive development can help us to understand as well as teach children at their own level. The Process of Cognitive Change Our textbook provides a good summary of the structure (stages) of cognitive development. The section, however, does not address the process by which a person moves from one stage to the next. Piaget believed that the key to cognitive development is something called cognitive conflict or cognitive disequilibrium. For cognitive development to proceed, the individual must constantly re-evaluate his or her schemas. According to Piaget, we develop schemas from an early age of life. Schemas are our cognitive representations of the world. Schemas help us to organize our experiences. They also allow us to make predictions about what outcomes might result from particular behaviours. Schemas are very important in helping us to understand and to adapt to the world. Although schemas are important in helping us to understand the world, they are not always accurate. People at all ages can have mental representations of the world that are not correct. Can you think of any examples of inaccurate schemas? Although people at all ages can have inaccurate mental representations of the world, children are especially prone to view the world in an incorrect way. The reason children may view the world in an incorrect way is because the structure of their cognitive processing is developing. Piaget believed that inaccurate schemas are changed only when they are challenged in the cognitive structure of the child. This challenge has been termed cognitive conflict. Basically, the process of cognitive change works as follows: People are motivated to maintain a state of cognitive equilibrium. When a child encounters information from the world and the information is inconsistent with his or her schema, the new piece of information creates a state of disequilibrium or cognitive conflict. Equilibrium may be restored through one of the two processes of adapation called assimilation and accommodation. Assimilation occurs when a child re-organizes the new information in such a way as to make the new piece of information consistent with his or her preexisting schema of the world. Accommodation occurs when a child alters his or her schema such that the new piece of information can now be incorporated into the new schema. Thus the process of accommodation produces the greatest cognitive change. Can you think of examples of both assimilation and accommodation? Here is an example: Equilibrium-Preexisting Schema: Child has grown up in an environment where all people he interacted with were of the same race (mom, dad, siblings, grandma, grandpa, etc.) Child has seen people of other racial groups, but has never interacted with them. Child develops the schema that people tend to like others who are of the same race as him or her. Cognitive Conflict Produced: At four years of age the child begins to attend preschool. At this time he starts to interact with children of various races. The child begins to develop a friendship with a child of a different race. This friendship creates cognitive conflict for the child: “How can I like someone who is a different color?” To resolve this cognitive conflict, the child has two options: Option A- Assimilation: In order to maintain his or her preexisting schema, the child re-organizes the information such that the other child is not perceived to be so dissimilar after all: “Maybe he is a different color from me, but we both speak English. We must not be so dissimilar after all.” Option B- Accommodation: The child’s preexisting schema is altered such that the new information can be incorporated into a new way of perceiving the world, “Maybe I can be friends with someone who is different from me.” Cognitive Equilibrium is Restored Although cognitive equilibrium is restored via either assimilation or accommodation, assimilation serves to maintain an inaccurate schema (that differences inhibit the development of friendships) whereas accommodation serves to produce cognitive change and hence produces a more accurate representation of the world (that differences do not inhibit the development of friendships).

The last link is a test - along with the first three links, it is intended to provide some insights about your developmental trajectory in light of your crisis resolution, attachment style, and parenting styles: Erik Erikson’s Stages of Social-Emotional Development Attachment Issues in Children: Causes, Symptoms, Treatment Seven Tips for Stepfamily Success What is Your Parenting Style Activity: Questions for Consideration Before moving on, take a moment to consider the following questions: What is God like for children of different levels of cognitive development? If you can, give some examples from children you know…. Would children even have an idea of God if they were not taught it? Be prepared to share your thoughts with other members of the class 3.3 Adolescence John has just turned 13. Over the past year he has experienced may changes. He has grown over six inches and he has developed acne over his face and back. Not only is he changing physically, he is also experiencing a wave of emotional, spiritual, cognitive, and sexual changes. John has become self-focused and very self-critical. In addition, he is beginning to think abstractly and to challenge adults’ “dominion” on knowledge. John is also on a quest to understand “who he is” and “what his place is in the world”. John’s quest for an identity makes him more vulnerable to peer pressure and to the influence of radical groups and cults. During this time that we call adolescence, John will make many decisions that will have a profound effect on the direction his life will take. Does any of the above sound familiar? Before you begin reading the textbook section on adolescence, think back to your own adolescence. As you think about your experience of adolescence, use the following questions to guide your reflection: What physical changes did you experience in adolescence? How did these physical changes make you feel? In what ways did your view of the world change during adolescence? How did your way of treating other people change during adolescence? What was most important to you during adolescence? To what extent is “who you are today” a function of “who you became during adolescence”? No Adolescence? In other times and in other cultures to­day, adolescence does not exist as a significant and distinct period of develop­ment. This might seem surprising and difficult to imagine. Think of how modern society would be different, or if it could even exist, without a period of adolescence. What are the advantages and disadvantages of having an adolescent period? Identity The concept of identity is a rich topic for consideration. The most familiar aspect of identity is occupational identity, since much of “who we are” in our society rests on the kind of work we do. Perhaps you can readily relate to this in your choice of major. Less familiar, but equally important, is ideological identity. Ideologi­cal identity, including both religious and political orientations, may un­dergo a tremen­dous upheaval during your student years. Do you have the same political beliefs as your parents? What about religious beliefs? Conflict and questioning of parental beliefs and values may be a necessary part of establishing your personal iden­tity—even if the beliefs and values you ultimately adopt are the same as those of your parents.

(2024). Revel for An Introduction to Psychological Science, 4th Canadian Edition. Pearson Ed. Other resources will be provided online. 4.1 Adulthood Psychosocial Development There are many changes we experience during the time we call adulthood. According to Erikson’s theory of psychosocial development, adults move through three important stages during which they must resolve important psychosocial conflicts: Early Adulthood Middle Adulthood Late Adulthood In Early Adulthood (20-40 years of age) the psychosocial crisis is one of intimacy versus isolation. Although it is often perceived as critical whether or not the person develops an intimate relationship with a lifelong partner, Erikson believed that although this is one component of intimacy in this stage, other types of intimacy are also important—like developing intimate relationships with workmates, colleagues, and even one’s children. If one fails to develop a sense of intimacy during this stage, he or she will feel isolation. In Middle Adulthood (40-65 years of age) the psychosocial crises is one of generativity versus stagnation. What is generativity? Erikson used the term gererativity to describe the process by which a person feels like he or she is making a lasting contribution in the world. Usually, generativity involves giving something back to the next generation. People at this stage can feel generative in many ways—coaching a softball team, being a scout leader, teaching children in Sunday School, been a big brother/sister, etc. If a person fails to develop a sense of generativity during this stage, he or she will feel a sense of stagnation. In Late Adulthood (65+ years of age) the psychosocial crisis is one of ego integrity versus despair. If the individual looks back on his or her life and feels a sense of pride in the accomplishments he or she has made, then the individual will feel a sense of ego integrity. However, if the person looks back on his or her life and does not see the significance of his or her accomplishments, then he or she will feel a sense of despair at the meaninglessness of his or her life. Guilt One of the most significant developments in childhood, from both a secular and Christian point of view, is a conscience with its attendant guilt. Is guilt simply a conditioned emotional response (as the behaviorist might say)? Is it the result of conflict with the superego (as a psychoanalyst would say)? Is it the failure to live up to our self-concept (as the humanist might say)? Is it the voice of the Holy Spirit? Or is it some combination of these? (For help on this issue and an important distinction between false and true guilt see Counts and Narramore (1970), Narramore (1984), Tournier (1962).) (from Psychology and Christianity, by Ronald Philipchalk, p. 146) The textbook discusses moral development in childhood and adolescence. However, many adults are troubled by questions of right and wrong, and in particular, by feelings of guilt. The Christian authors noted above suggest that many guilt feelings are not true guilt but false guilt carried over from childhood experiences. Understanding how conscience and guilt feelings develop can help to liberate us from unnecessary false guilt inappropriately attributed to God. Activity: Read and Reflect This activity involves some reading and reflection around Erikson’s Eight Psychosocial Stages and an article from Harvard University illuminating the importance of relationships in healthy aging. Erik Erikson’s Stages of Social-Emotional Development Good Genes are Nice, but Joy is Better Activity: Questions for Consideration Take some time to consider what you have learned in this section. Think about the following questions: What do you hope to accomplish during your “adult development” years? (If you are past these years, what are you most pleased with?) Be prepared to share your thoughts with other members of the class 4.2 Death and Dying Death Secular psychologists see death as final. Christians, however, see resurrection beyond, with death being but another step in that direction. What implications do these beliefs have for the process of dying? As medical technology has advanced death has become more and more difficult to define. We need to focus our attention less on preserving the physical and more on preserving the personhood of the individual. This means giving greater attention to our concept of the dying person created in the image of God (as the abortion issue has forced us to do at the other end of life). When is personhood sacrificed to technical efficiency? Should we advocate a more “natural death?” What is “natural death?” How far does one go in “allowing” natural death? (from Psychology and Christianity, by Ronald Philipchalk, p. 146) Hospice You matter because of who you are. You matter to the last moment of your life, and we will do all we can not only to help you die peacefully, but also to live until you die.” (Dame Cicely Saunders) During the Crusades of the Middle Ages a hospice provided lodging for travelers: a place of refuge and comfort. So in 1967, when Dame Cicley Saunders opened a facility in London to provide care and comfort to dying people and their families, St. Christopher’s hospice was an appropriate name.

Cultural Variations The following issues are often subject to cul­tural variations: Adolescence is unknown in some cultures Adolescent struggles and conflict are much less in some cultures (e.g., ) Stage theories may not apply in other cultures Ageism, especially with regard to intellectual abilities, is reduced, unknown, or even reversed in some cultures where the wisdom of old age is venerated The “social clock” may be set differently in other cultures Attitudes toward death vary greatly between cultures 4.3 Assessment Refer to the course schedule for graded assignments you are responsible for submitting.

The study of personality attempts to answer the questions: Who are you? and, How did you become who you are? As human’s are astoundingly complex, there is not any one theory that can capture, in totality, a description of who you are; hence, there are numerous approaches and theories that attempt to address these questions.

In doing this we examine several major perspectives. Within each of these there are many variations (e.g., Adler, Jung, and Freud within the psychoanalytic perspective). If you would like to know more about this area, you might be interested in taking the course “Theories of Personality” (Psychology 301 at TWU). Aside from all these more formal theories, each of us has an implicit personality theory. This is our personal idea of what people are like, including which personality characteristics go together. For example, we think of people who are attractive and intelligent as likable rather than unlikable. Our socialization leads us to assume certain traits go together. As you go through this chapter, you may find some approaches are closer to your own assumptions (implicit theory), and you may prefer these approaches to others. You may also find your implicit theory becomes more explicit. Finally, you may even modify your own theory in the face of new information. Dreams “And afterward, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions” (Joel 2:28). God apparently spoke through dreams many times in the bible, and in Joel 2:28 He promised to do so in the future. Does God still (or again) speak through dreams? Are we missing out on a possible leading from God when we ignore our dreams? If you would like to read more on this subject you might be interested in books by Christians on this subject. For example, see John A. Sanford’s Dreams, God’s Forgotten Language, or Morton T. Kelsey’s God, Dreams, and Revelation, or Abraham Schmitt’s Before I Wake. The website below (cf. Online Resources) contains some balanced advice. Also, voice your opinion or give your experience in the online discussion. Birth Order You may be familiar with Adler’s concept of the family constellation, which implies that position in the family has a powerful effect on goals, self-concept, and ways of relating to others. As a test of this concept, think of a three-child family, all of whom were born within a few years (using larger families makes things too complicated). Try applying Adler’s theory to predict which child in the family is likely to be: the best student the most shy the most helpful around the house the most outgoing the “hell raiser” the most “helpless” the charmer the “baby” of the family You will not always be right—but neither was Adler. The important thing is to note that Adler made psychology aware of the different expectations and social influences on different children in the same family. In some respects, children in the same position in different families are more alike than are children in differ­ent positions in the same family Activity: Read and Reflect Having just introduced Personality Theories to the course, we begin to explore psychoanalytic views of human development. Dreams and birth order are but two of the constructs that help shape and reflect who we are as individuals- there are many different theories and interpretations on the role dreams and birth order play. Take a moment to consider the following articles: Christian Perspective on Dreams Birth Order and Your Personality Activity: Questions for Consideration Take a moment to reflect on what you have learned in this section. Use the following questions to guide your self-reflection: Does God speak through dreams? What reasons do you have for your opinion? Can you give an example? Be prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class. 5.2 Humanistic View Self-Esteem In 1890, William James gave a simple formula for self-esteem: James explained: Such a fraction may be increased as well by diminishing the denominator as by increasing the numerator. To give up pretensions is as blessed a relief as to get them gratified; and where disappointment is incessant and the struggle unending, this is what men will always do. . . . How pleasant is the day we give up striving to be young—or slenderThank Godwe say, those illusions are gone. (James, 1890) (Quoted from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ron Philipchalk) In his textbook, David Myers discusses the pros and cons of promoting self-esteem. Consider also the following: Self-Esteem: A Contrary View Self-esteem is a popular topic in North American society and researchers have expended a vast amount of effort studying it. Approximately 10,000 studies have explored the possible relationship between self-esteem and various human problems (Scheff et al., 1989). The assumption that low self-esteem is at the root of many personal and social problems has reached the level of a cultural truism. The California legislature (1990) has even established a task force to promote self-esteem, believing that enhanced self-esteem is a vaccine against drug abuse, teen-age pregnancy, welfare dependency, and other social ills. Sharon Neuman (1992) suggests that the need to enhance self-esteem has become a “motherhood issue”—meaning that belief in its value is so widely accepted it goes unquestioned. Recently, however, several authors have begun to challenge this focus on raising self-esteem. They point out that high self-esteem can sometimes be detrimental, if, for example, it leads people to set inappropriate, risky goals that are beyond their capabilities (Baumeister, et al., 1993a). In addition, the relationship between self-esteem and other measures of well-being is often weak or nonexistent (Burr &amp; Christensen, 1992; Hermans, 1992; Jackson, 1984). Perhaps most importantly, high self-esteem may be the result and not the cause of other positive tendencies (Alexander &amp; Baker, 1992). Sharon Neuman (1992) argues that self-esteem must follow, not precede, real achievement. She claims that no number of self-esteem programs can replace the genuine satisfaction of a job well done. Wesley Burr and Clark Christensen (1992) suggest that the idea that we must esteem ourselves highly before we can value and love others is a “Western myth.” They add: We would improve our thinking if we were to take the idea that “we cannot love others until we love ourself” and turn it 180 degrees to be: “We cannot love ourself until we love others.” We would further improve our thinking if we then concluded that this is a fairly irrelevant and unimportant idea anyway because it still implies that loving ourself is what is important. (p. 464) Burr and Christensen suggest that self-esteem is a fruit and not a root of healthy emotional connections between people. (From Invitation to Social Psychology by Ron Philipchalk) 5.3 Christianity &amp; Humanism Some Christians object to the humanistic perspective because of its unqualified affirmation of human goodness and its apparent promotion of self-love. It is important to note, however, that humanistic psychology is not to be equated with the philosophy and social movement called humanism. Although it focuses on humans, so too do other approaches to personality. (The behavioral psychologist B.F. Skinner was a signatory to the Humanist Manifesto but a major opponent of humanistic psychology.) In his authoritative work on the history of psychology, Ernest Hilgard writes, “Humanistic psychology as something contemporary is not to be confused with other forms of humanism, such as humanistic studies which refer to classical or liberal arts topics, or that form of humanism which sets itself against theological beliefs (1987, p. 504). In fact, J.I. Packer and Thomas Howard in their book Christianity: The true humanism (1985) argue that only Christianity gives a valid basis for assuming humans have value. Activity: Read and Reflect As we explore a humanistic view, as it relates to personality, we start to see the development of self-esteem. Take some time to read through the following resources and consider how they connect to what you have learned: Kids Health: Self Esteem National Association for Self-Esteem Society for Humanistic Psychology The purpose of these resources is to help you assess your self-esteem, help to build a healthy self-esteem, and to provide you with a credible site for learning more about Humanistic Psychology. Activity: Question for Consideration Consider the following question - think about how it connects to what you have learned in this section: If you wanted to study the psychologically healthiest individuals, whom would you study? How would you decide? Be prepared to share your thoughts with other members of the class 5.4 Trait View Trait Theory In the previous lesson we discussed implicit theories of personality. Many people’s implicit theories include elements of trait theory. They believe that personality is made up of traits. For example, popular ideas of leadership and success often rest on this assumption (e.g., Traits for success). Actually this view is quite old, going back to the ancient Greeks: Almost 2,000 years ago a Greek physician named Galen suggested that there were four basic types of personality, based on four different “humors,” or fluids, in the body. Galen called these personality types sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, and melancholic. When Eysenck combined his two basic personality scales, he found that he had a “less humorous” version of a classic theory. (from Understanding Human Behavior by Ron Philipchalk &amp; James McConnell) In psychology today there is a growing effort towards accurate measurement of personality traits, and investigation of the ways in which traits interact with the environment. One of the most popular applications of trait theory is in the prediction of employee success. After looking at the “Big 5,” which trait do you think is the most important? Imagine you own a business and you have to make a quick decision to hire one of 5 very similar applicants. The only trait measure you have is each applicant’s score on the “Big 5.” The only problem is that each one scores high on a different factor. Which one would you hire? Measuring Personality The trait approach to personality is closely linked to the matter of psychological testing. The strength of this approach is that it provides quantifiable data for analysis and comparison. The weakness is the difficulty in measuring traits accurately. Remember our discussion of standardization, validity, and reliability of intelligence tests? Personality tests must also meet the same criteria. (An additional problem is that our situations guide us as well as our traits.) This is an important point to remember when you encounter the many so-called personality tests in the popular media. Barnum Effect Do you have a desire to know what “kind” of person you are? This common desire can be used to manipulate you in a variety of ways. As discussed in the textbook, sometimes it is easier to make people believe that you are measuring their personality than it is to actually measure it. In fact, it is remarkably easy for people to be convinced that a personality profile describes them well. This phenomena is known as “the Barnum effect,” after the circus showman P. T. Barnum. The Barnum effect hearkens back to the late 1940s, when psychologist Bertram Forer gave research participants a personality test and then generated a personality description that subjects believed was based on their test responses. Even though all participants were given exactly the same personality description, they found the profile to be highly convincing and descriptive of them as an individual. When asked to rate how well the profile described them, on a scale ranging from 0 (very poor) to 5 (excellent), the average rating was an impressive 4.26 (Forer, 1949)You, too, can try this experiment. Read the personality description below and rate, on a scale ranging from 0 (very poor) to 5 (excellent), how well this description describes you: You have a strong need for other people to like you and for them to ad­mire you. You have a tendency to be critical of yourself. You have a great deal of unused energy which you have not turned to your advantage. While you have personality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them. Your sexual adjustment has presented some problems for you. Dis­ci­plined and controlled on the outside, you tend to be worrisome and in­se­cure inside. At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing. You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed-in by restrictions and limitations. You pride yourself as being an independent thinker and do not accept other opinions without satisfactory proof. You have found it un­wise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others. At times you are extro­verted, affable, sociable, while at other times you are introverted, wary, and reserved. Some of your aspirations tend to be pretty unrealistic. Activity: Practice, Read, and Reflect In this topic we have continued to develop our understanding of personality. Below are some tests you can take - consider the results and reflect on how useful these types of resources are in assessing personality: Queendom.com Queendom.com is a great resource for different kinds of tests. You will be looking specifically at Personality tests on this site. When you go to www.queendom.com, click on the “TESTS, QUIZZES &amp; POLLS” tab and select TESTS. From the PERSONALITY TESTS list select ONE of the following personality tests: DISC Personality Test Big Five Personality Test Self-Control &amp; Self-Monitoring Test Happiness Test Locus Of Control &amp; Attributional Style Test Interact with the results and ponder whether or not you think the test is accurate or inaccurate and whether or not the information provided seems unique to you or could it be applied to anyone given the right situation. Activity: Question for Consideration Take a moment to reflect on the following question - consider how they connect to what you have learned in this section: What is the role of heredity in personality? Is our personality inherited and set for life? Can it be modified? Author Tim LaHaye has taken the Greek idea of types and body humors and adapted it to a Christian perspective incorporating the concept of spiritual gifts. Does the bible support an approach to personality that links individual differences to inherited traits? What is the role of the Holy Spirit in relationship to traits? - Are these different “gifts” (I Cor. 12)? Different “fruit (Gal 5:22)? Can they be changed? Be prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class 5.5 Social-Cognitive View You + Your Environment Social-Cognitive Theory (SCT) was originally formulated by Albert Bandura at Stanford University. The fundamental premise of SCT is that models serve as the basis for learning new behaviours and that learning occurs in a social context with a dynamic and reciprocal interaction of the person, environment, and behavior; this is known as reciprocal determinism. Its emphasis is on external and internal social reinforcement and how these factors shape and maintain behavior in different environments. The theory also recognizes the influence of a person’s past experiences, which factor into whether behavioral action will occur. These past experiences serve as the primary reinforcements and expectancies, shaping whether or not a person will engage in a specific behavior and answering why a person engages in that behaviour. In summary, the Social-Cognitive view recognizes the mutual interdependence (“reciprocal determinism”) of individual qualities and situations. While we do have individual patterns of behaviour, we exhibit these according to the way we perceive our situation. Activity: Read and Reflect Who we are is, in large part, shaped by the environment in which live. Take a moment to consider the following resources and how they relate to this concept: Learned Helplessness Learned Optimism The above resources will help you to think about how your environment can impact your sense of agency (the ability to choose your behaviours to impact the environment) and how your sense of agency can influence your environment. This demonstrates the key idea of Social-Cognitive Theory, that you are in a constant, dynamic relationship with your environment and each factor is shaped by the other. Activity: Chapter 12 Key Terms Quiz In order to review some of the major terms from Chapter 12 in your textbook, take the following unmarked quiz. Although you will not be evaluated on these terms, they will assist you in the assessments for this course: Activity: Questions for Consideration Take a moment to reflect on what you have learned in this section. Read the following statement and consider the questions below: Research indicates that an internal locus of control is associated with more positive psychological outcomes than an external locus of control. Does this mean that Christians (and others who believe in God) are less psychologically healthy because they believe an external force (God) is in control? *Be prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class.

In a way, everyone is a social psychologist. People constantly form ideas/opinions about why a person or a group of people are acting the way they are. Social psychology is similar to what people find themselves naturally doing except it uses scientific tools to study these hypotheses (the ideas/opinions). Social psychologist are primarily interested in examining the different ways that individual’s effect groups of people and the way groups of people effect individual’s. In this unit you will be introduced to some historical studies and main concepts in this field. Topics covered in this chapter include social influences on behaviour, social impressions and judgements, the relationship between attitudes and behaviour, and effective communication. Unit 6 (Part 1) looks at attributes and actions, conformity, obedience, and compliance. Unit 7 (Part 2) examines prejudice and aggression, and, though not specifically covered in the textbook, yet important to social psychology, attraction and altruism. Topics This unit is divided into the following topics: Attributes and Actions Conformity Obedience Compliance Learning Outcomes By the end of this unit, student’s will be able to: Define, and apply, the key terminology associated with social influence, social cognition, and on attitudes, behaviour, and effective communication. Describe why individuals conform to others’ behaviours, how individuals and groups can influence behaviours, and how we form first impressions and how these impressions influence us. Apply your knowledge of the bystander effect to ensure that you will be helped if you are in an emergency, of social cognition to help overcome prejudice and discrimination, and of the central route to describe how a message should be designed. Analyze whether guards who participate in abuse are inherently bad people, or if their behaviour is the product of social influences and whether people who commit discriminatory acts are necessarily prejudiced. Describe how behaviours influence attitudes in terms of cognitive dissonance theory. Activity Checklist: Here is a checklist of learning activities you will benefit from in completing this unit.

Other resources will be provided online. 6.1 Attributes and Actions The Ultimate Attribution Error If you study attribution further, perhaps in a “Social Psychology” course, you find that there are several errors in attribution common to our perceptions of behavior. The ultimate attribution error is a combination of biases that influences our interpretation of behavior in our friends and our foes. The ultimate attribution error is our tendency to use internal attributions to explain socially desirable actions by members of our own group and socially undesirable actions by members of an opposing group. The same bias leads us to use external attributions to explain socially undesirable actions of our own group and socially desirable actions of our foes (Hewstone, 1988; Pettigrew, 1979, 1980 ; Taylor and Jaggi, 1974 ). A study by Donald Taylor and V. Jaggi (1974) illustrates this bias among south Indian subjects. Taylor and Jaggi found that Hindu subjects attributed socially desirable actions to the good character of Hindus, but attributed the same actions in Muslims to environmental circumstances. In addition, Hindu subjects blamed socially undesirable actions on Hindus’ circumstances and Muslims’ character. We commit the ultimate attribution error when we say, “Our soldiers fight because they have to” (external attribution), but “Our enemies fight because they are warlike” (internal attribution). cf galleys And, “Our soldiers are naturally brave”; “Our enemies are forced to do daring deeds.” The ultimate attribution error tends to perpetuate our false stereotypes and prejudices. Our biased interpretations have a plausible ring because the reasons for our enemies’ actions are usually somewhat ambiguous and open to various interpretations. In addition, our friends fall into the same error and support our views. Consequently, we continue to see behavior the way we expect or would like it to be, and people we don’t like never get a chance to prove us wrong. (from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ronald Philipchalk) Actions and Attitudes “You can’t legislate morality” is a commonsense chestnut that social psycholo­gists have found not to be true. Attitudes do follow behavior. Eliot Aronson makes a persuasive argument that racial prejudiced attitudes and behaviors in the have actually responded dramatically and positively to civil rights legisla­tion and to court actions in the last several decades. In addition, he discusses sev­eral other methods that have been successfully used to reduce prejudice and discrimination, including his “jigsaw” technique, designed for use with grade school children. Aronson, E. (1992). The social animal (6th ed.). New York: W. H. Freeman. Activity: Read and Reflect Attributes, and our perception of attributes, has been the focus of this lesson. Take a moment to read through the following resources and consider how they connect to what you have learned: Attribution Theory Cognitive Dissnonance These articles bring to light phenomena that tend to occur automatically (without conscious processing) for most people. Now that the concepts of attribution and cognitive dissonance are in your awareness it could be valuable to thoughtfully consider which attribution style you tend towards (dispositional or situational) and how that style influences how you treat others and how others respond to you. And, then ask, what am I doing with my cognitive dissonance? Do I tend to change my attitudes to fit my behaviours or do I adjust my behaviours to be alignment with my attitudes, values, and beliefs? Activity: Questions for Consideration Consider the following questions: Describe a time when you were forced to act in a certain way, and then later found you had come to enjoy what you were doing. That is, your attitude followed your actions. Could this happen with religious attitudes and beliefs too? Be prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class 6.2 Conformity “Oh, God, the terrible tyranny of the majority.” (from Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, p. 97) Conformity, vs. Compliance &amp; Obedience In this lesson, and the next two, we will be looking at social influence. Because this is a large and interesting topic we will discuss three types of social influence separately, conformity, compliance, and obedience. Conformity, our topic for today, refers to going along with other people without anyone explicitly asking you to. Compliance refers to going along with the request of another person when you have a choice not to. Being influenced by a salesperson to buy something is an example of compliance. Obedience refers to going along with an order when no choice is offered, as in the army. Norms Group expectations or norms exert a powerful influence on our behavior. We generally go along with what people expect of us not because we have to but because resistance is so uncomfortable. You can experience the power of group norms in controlling your behavior if you attempt to violate a norm for acceptable behavior (e.g., go the front of a line and edge in; ask someone for their seat on a bus or subway; sit close to a stranger in a public place when other seats are available). Using Conformity At the lowest level of social influence people are observed to go along with what other people are doing, often without being asked. Adults are frequently critical of adolescents for conforming to erratic youthful fashions, while they are often just as bound to their own conservative guidelines (why else would anyone where a necktie?). Conformity is a common and usually harmless part of everyday life; yet it can lead to complacent and even erroneous judgments. In a classic study of conformity approximately one-third of the subjects gave what they knew to be the wrong answer when four other “subjects” (actually confederates of the experimenter) gave the same wrong answer (Asch, 1952, 1955). Although frequently innocuous, conformity can be harmful when it is inappropriate. Are Christians abusing the power of conformity when they pre- arrange for volunteers to “go forward” at an altar call in order to increase the number of non-Christians who will respond? Or are they merely being sensitive to the pressures that the non-Christian feels to conform to those who remain in their seats? Should Christians use this technique of influence? (from Psychology and Christianity by Ronald Philipchalk, p212) Conformity &amp; Culture Researcher Gary Lee and his associates found significant differences among 122 cultures in the emphasis given to conformity. Conformity differences de­velop as a result of socialization of children into parental values. Parents in cul­tures emphasizing conformity relied more heavily on physical punishment than parents in cultures emphasizing self-reliance. Mach Test The “Mach Test” is a twenty-item inventory designed to reveal Machiavellian tenden­cies, a manipulative kind of social skill. Based on Machiavelli’s writings, the in­stru­ment purports to identify people who, under social pressure, are able to retain their composure, while others are losing control. You can get an idea of your mach score, and thus presumably your tendency to use and be influenced by social influence, at: Mach Test Activity: Read and Reflect We investigated conformity, and the role it plays. The following resources will help support your understanding: Introduction to Social Influence Conformity AND Obedience Due to the pervasiveness of social influence, it cannot be overstated how important it is to understand the concepts and techniques associated with it. The purpose of these resources is to allow you to grow in your ability to be persuasive and to recognize when tools of influence are being used on you. It will also allow you to be more mindful of what/who you are conforming to and why it is that you are doing so. If you are really adventurous you may even want to take this knowledge to help you or someone else adopt a new attitude, belief, or action. Activity: Questions for Consideraton Take a moment to consider the following questions in light of what you have learned in this section: What pressures for conformity exist in your community? On your campus? What happens to people who do not conform? Is conformity good or bad? What would society be like without conformity? Be prepared to share your thoughts with other members of the class 6.3 Obedience Obedience refers to the strongest level of social influence, the level at which an order is given and no choice is assumed. For example, we are expected to obey the law; we are not assumed to have a choice. The study of obedience has proven somewhat unsettling for those with an optimistic view of human nature. Under orders, people have been willing to (a) subdue a helpless protesting individual with electric shock labeled extremely dangerous (Milgram, 1963); (b) administer a drug to a patient at double the recommended dosage, when the drug had not been approved by the hospital and when, contrary to regulations, the orders were given by an unfamiliar physician over the phone (Hofling et al., 1966), (c) place cute puppies in a restraining harness and give them strong electric shock (Sheridan and King, 1972). However, rather than uncovering a sadistic or evil type of individual these studies indicate that in the momentum of the situation, and under legitimate authority, people will perform acts which they would otherwise find abhorrent. The ominous parallel with so-called “war crimes” is clear. Soldiers from many countries and in various wars have committed heinous acts of cruelty and slaughter against innocent men, women, and children. Yet they were not particularly evil or sadistic men; they were simply following orders. The research on obedience raises the chilling possibility that anyone of us would do the same thing in the same situation. The potentially destructive power of religious authority was clearly demonstrated in 1978. In Jonestown, Guyana, more than 900 followers of religious-cult leader Jim Jones obeyed his orders and committed suicide by drinking poison. Christian leaders need to beware of the awesome power of their position, particularly when they claim to speak as the voice of God. (from Psychology and Christianity by Ronald Philipchalk, p. 214-215) Avoiding Destructive Obedience How can you protect yourself from participating in destructive obedience? Actually, you may have already taken the first step. Growing evidence suggests that when people learn about research findings such as these, they tend to change their behavior to take this knowledge into account (Sherman, 1980). There are, however, several more active steps you can take to reduce your vulnerability to malevolent authority. First, you can question the legitimacy of the authority. Ask yourself if the person giving the orders really has the right to command you to do what he or she is asking. Special uniforms, insignias, and titles can create an aura of authority even where none exists. For example, Brad Bushman found that 72 % of pedestrians gave change to a young man when ordered to by a woman in uniform, compared to 48 % when the woman was dressed in business clothes. Bushman found that the nature of the uniform did not even have to be related to the order being given (Bushman, 1984, 1988). Second, ask yourself if your obedience might cause harm to someone else. Remember that even if you act under legitimate authority you are still responsible for any harm you produce. Third, talk to others about your misgivings. This can not only strengthen your personal resolve, but it may also convince others to join you as well. In one field experiment, 21 out of 22 nurses were prepared to obey an unfamiliar physician whose order violated hospital policy and possibly endangered the patients. The nurses had no chance to consult with anyone else (Hofling et al., 1966). In a second study, however, when the nurses were given the opportunity to contact their supervisors and other nurses, only 2 out of 18 were willing to obey (Rank &amp; Jacobson, 1977). Milgram also demonstrated the effect of support for disobedience. In one experiment he employed two additional confederates. They posed as co-teachers who, along with the real subject, gave shocks to the “learner.” One confederate refused to continue at 150 volts, the other confederate broke off at 210 volts. With this type of additional support, 90 % of the subjects refused to go all the way to the maximum shock—total obedience was reduced to 10 % (Milgram, 1974). Finally, if you decide to defy authority, you might take a lesson from the conformity research and remember the power of calm, reasonable dissent. One of the most famous literary examples of defiance, Herman Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener, illustrates this “gentle rebellion:” “Bartleby,” said I, “Ginger Nut is away; just step round to the Post Office, won’t you? (it was but a three minute walk), and see if there is anything for me.” “I would prefer not to.” “You will not?” “I prefer not.” I staggered to my desk, and sat there in a deep study. My blind inveteracy returned. Was there any other thing in which I could procure myself to be ignominiously repulsed by this lean, penniless wight?—my hired clerk? What added thing is there, perfectly reasonable, that he will be sure to refuse to do? “Bartleby” - No answer “Bartleby,” in a louder tone. - No answer. “Bartleby,” I roared. Like a very ghost, agreeably to the laws of magical invocation, at the third summons, he appeared at the entrance of his hermitage. “Go to the next room, and tell Nippers to come to me.” “I prefer not to,” he respectfully and slowly said, and mildly disappeared. Bartleby manages to defy his employer and yet keep his job because his meek reply is so disarming. At times a more aggressive stance may be necessary, but remember, resistance is always possible. Obedience should not be blind. (from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ronald Philipchalk) Activity: Read and Reflect This unit, we learned about obedience. We saw that obedience is strongest level of social influence. Read through the following resources and consider how they relate to what you have learned: Conformity, Compliance, and Obedience Milgram experiment facts for kids Canadian Code of Ethics for Psychologists Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct As mentioned earlier, it is not necessary to read each resource thoroughly. What is important is to gain comprehension of the importance of using ethical guidelines when doing research on conformity, compliance, and obedience. Start to ponder how necessary is it to involve the use of deception in research. Ask yourself how you would feel if you were actually part of an experiment that was measuring compliance and you were deceived about what the researchers were actually doing? Also, while reading this information have you been able to recognize areas of your life where you are unquestionably following an authority figure? When answering questions like this I would encourage you to not be overly critical of yourself or others, rather, just notice where certain phenomena are present in your life and if you would like to do anything about it. Activity: Questions for Consideration Read through the following and consider the questions below: When people read about Stanley Milgram’s experiments on obedience to au­thor­ity, they are often puzzled at the ethics of this research. You have probably have heard of these studies before and already have some views about the ap­propriate­ness of the procedures. All psychologists follow ethical guidelines in their research established by national governing bodies (e.g., CPA, APA). At the heart of these state­ments about ethics are the responsibilities to: protect the subject’s welfare, avoid deception, provide anonymity, and provide therapy or relief from any unin­tended results of the experiment. Each of these general principles applies to the Milgram studies. Do you believe that the studies could be conducted today, given what we know now about ethics and about Milgram’s results? Does the severity of the problem studied—in this case destructive obedience—justify more extreme steps to manipulate and deceive experimental subjects? Under what circumstances do you personally think that deceiving subjects in a scientific experiment might be ethically warranted or justified? Be prepared to share your thoughts with other members of the class 6.4 Compliance This fictitious letter, based upon actual appeals I have received, contains several examples of techniques of persuasion. Without criticizing the writer’s motives, a social psychologist could identify examples of card stacking, plain folks, foot-in-the-door, and other effective procedures of persuasion that we will discuss below. Compliance refers to an intermediate level of influence. Here we have the familiar situation where a request is made of us, but it is assumed that we have a choice; we don’t have to comply with the persuasive communication. In the letter we see the use of several techniques which have been found to increase the effectiveness of a persuasive communication: Card Stacking is the selection of only those examples which support the proponent’s argument (Mr. Smith’s example is presented as if it were typical). The Band Wagon Effect gives the impression that many other people are involved, and that everyone is doing it (“thousands of others are standing with you”). A Testimonial is a personal example of the successful application of the proponent’s argument (Mr. Smith provides a concrete example of what might be expected). Plain Folks refers to the association of the person or product with simple ordinary people (“this poor country boy”). The foot-in-the-door technique is the attempt to get you to comply in a small way, knowing that this greatly increases your chance of complying to a larger request (in our example reading the letter, using the “prayer square,” or sending a very small donation are small requests which could be followed up with requests for larger gifts). Name Calling is a technique which persuades people to reject something which they may know nothing about (“the forces of evil”). Transfer is the association of a person or product with something that people already feel strongly about (“God,” “family,” “children”). These and other techniques have been shown to greatly increase the effectiveness of a persuasive communication. They are often quite apparent in appeals by religious leaders for financial support. Should Christians use these techniques of influence? (from Psychology and Christianity by Ronald Philipchalk, p. 211, 213) Activity: Read and Reflect In this Topic we studied compliance and its use as a tool of influence. Take a moment to read through the following resources to further your understanding: Social Media and Its Stark Influence on Society Cults: Questions and Answers The purpose of the information being shared in this topic and through these resources is to help you recognize who and/or what you are allowing to be an influence in your life? Asking the question, “Who is teaching me how to be influential and what direction is that influence taking me in?” can be invaluable in helping you examine how you are spending your time and if you are truly satisfied in the direction of your life. Remember, tools of influence are just that – tools. Any tool can be used towards benefit or detriment, it just depends on how it is being applied. Activity: Questions for Consideration Take a moment to reflect on what you have learned this week. Use the following questions to guide your reflection: Have you ever been taught a sales technique in your job experience? If so, explain… If you have not been taught a sales technique, you certainly have experienced many as a consumer. Can you give an example? Here is one: One of the standard ways that door-to-door salespersons will try to get you to buy something is the so-called foot-in-the-door technique: They will ask you to do them a small favor. Having done so, you will have to justify your own behavior to yourself by think­ing nice things about the seller. Hence, you are more likely to comply when they ask you to sign on the dotted line. Be prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class Assessment Refer to the course schedule for graded assignments you are responsible for submitting.

No single factor has more impact on shaping the quality and direction of your life over virtually every aspect of your existence than relationships. In a way, everyone is a social psychologist. People constantly form ideas/opinions about why a person or a group of people are acting the way they are. Social psychology is similar to what people find themselves naturally doing except it uses scientific tools to study these hypotheses (the ideas/opinions). Social psychologist are primarily interested in examining the different ways that individual’s effect groups of people and the way groups of people effect individual’s. In this unit you will be introduced to some historical studies and main concepts in this field. Topics covered in this chapter include social influences on behaviour, social impressions and judgements, the relationship between attitudes and behaviour, and effective communication. In Unit 6 (Part 1) you looked at attributes and actions, conformity, obedience, and compliance. Please note that this unit will also examine prejudice and aggression. Although these topics are not specifically covered in the textbook, they are important to social psychology, attraction, and altruism. Topics This unit is divided into the following topics: Prejudice and Aggression Attraction and Altruism Learning Outcomes By the end of this unit, student’s will be able to: Define the key terminology associated with social influence, social cognition, and on attitudes, behaviour, and effective communication.

The consistent finding of this line of study was that the more religious people were, the more prejudiced they were likely to be Allport and Kramer (1946). Because racial prejudice is so clearly contrary to religious teaching, Gordon Allport called this Religion’s Grand Paradox. In the area of racial prejudice in North America, Christianity did not appear to improve behavior. Religion’s Grand Paradox was gradually resolved as researchers refined their definition of religious. When the apparently prejudiced church attenders were divided into those for whom religion served a social function and was a means to an end (extrinsic religious orientation) and those for whom religion was an integral part of their lives and an end in itself (intrinsic religious orientation), it was the extrinsics who had raised the prejudice scores of the entire group. The intrinsics were found to be even less prejudiced than the non-attenders. Apparently an intrinsic religious orientation has a beneficial effect on behavior, at least on racial prejudice (Allport, 1959). Sports as Catharsis? The idea that relieving emotional tension causes a purging of pent-up energy is called the catharsis hypothesis. According to Aristotle—who first proposed the concept of catharsis—even viewing powerful emotional events can be cathartic. Thus we should be able to reduce our aggressive tendencies by watching others act out their aggression, as well as by acting aggressively ourselves. Research, however, does not lend much support to this common-sense idea. For example, Robert Arms and his associates report that hockey, football, and wrestling fans exhibit more aggression after viewing the event than before (Arms et al., 1979; Goldstein &amp; Arms, 1971; Russell, 1983) (see Figure 11.1). Arthur Patterson (1974) found that high school football players were more aggressive after the season than before it. And Dane Archer and Rosemary Gartner report that a nation’s murder rate tends to jump after a war is over (Archer &amp; Gartner, 1976). Compensatory Machoism Marshall Segall and his colleagues point out that cultures typically expect men to be macho —that is, to behave in ways that indicate their strength, virility, and willingness to confront an adversary. But Segall and his colleagues suggest that biological mechanisms interact with complex cultural processes to produce a kind of “compensatory machoism.” Very briefly, the elements in this process are these: All societies have some division of labor by sex, resulting in sex-linked roles. For example, females do most of the child rearing in most societies and virtually all of it in some. Boys have less opportunity than girls to learn their roles by modeling because they are raised by women and have comparatively little contact with adult males. For various historical and environmental reasons, fathers in some societies are more likely to be absent. Paradoxically, in these societies young males are expected to develop a particularly distinct male identity. These young males are driven—consciously or unconsciously—to display “manly” behavior and avoid appearing “womanly” at all costs. Some societies recognize this need and provide initiation ceremonies that serve to “stamp in” masculinity for boys who need it because of inadequate opportunity to acquire it in childhood. These ceremonies affirm the young male’s adult masculinity. Adolescent males in societies without initiation ceremonies may exaggerate their biological tendencies toward aggression in an attempt to assert their own masculinity. Segall and his associates explain, “We suggest that in societies that have the preconditions requiring a stamping-in of masculinity, but which don’t achieve this through initiation ceremonies or other institutionalized practices, adolescent males will try on their own to assert their masculinity” (p. 281). The Segall group calls the resultant aggression compensatory machoism. Compensatory machoism is the display of behavior intended to identify oneself with the cultural image of masculinity. The resulting aggression is rooted not in anger but in a “felt need to escape from womanliness and to mark one’s masculine gender” (p. 281). Can you think of a cultural group in North America that seems to illustrate this process particularly well? Marshall Segall and his colleagues suggest that many young black American males illustrate this process. Social conditions (unemployment, educational deficits, racial discrimination) contribute to a prevalence of broken homes with female-headed households. Young men in these conditions attempt to assert their masculine identity through compensatory machoism. They are tough, independent, and violently aggressive. As a result, murder is their leading cause of death. A black man in stands a 1-in-21 chance of being murdered in his lifetime, compared with 1 in 131 for white men and 1 in 369 for white women. The Segall group quotes one young black male who says that in urban ghettos “You must walk angry, talk angry, think angry . . . . You’re either a chump or a champ . . . . You’re macho or gay.” (adapted from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ronald Philipchalk) Empathy &amp; Aggression Several researchers suggest that empathy and concern for others may be important tools for reducing aggression. Prejudice, discrimination, and violent sexual aggression flourish when we dehumanize a victim. If a policeman is a “pig,” a homosexual a “fag,” or a woman a “playmate,” “pet,” or “bitch,” it is easier to excuse and even justify our hostile actions. Empathy reverses this process by making us identify with a potential victim. For example, Ken-Ichi Ohbuchi and his colleagues found that Japanese students gave less shock to a “victim” if the victim first aroused subjects’ empathy by disclosing information about herself or by expressing her fear of shock. (adapted from Invitation to Social Psychology by Ronald Philipchalk) Conflict Resolution &amp; Culture Fumie Kumagai and Murray Straus report significant differences in the way con­flicts are resolved between marital partners in different cultures. Using the “Conflict Tactics Scale,” these researchers asked high school seniors in, and the United States how their parents settled disputes. Violent means of “resolution” were most common in American couples, followed by Japanese, and then Indian couples. Activity: Read and Reflect The following articles are intended to deepen your understanding of discrimination, racism, hate and violence. Hopefully this information will cause you to consider how you’ve been informed about these topics. Additionally, it may be valuable, in light of the research, to consider how much hate and violence you have exposure to through gaming and TV and how this is impacting your attitude and behaviour towards other people. Click on the articles below: Discussing Hate and Violence with Children Resolution on Violent Video Games Television and Video Violence Activity: Questions for Consideration Take a moment to reflect on what you have learned in this section. Use the following questions to guide your reflection: If removing parts of the brain reliably reduced aggression, do you think violent criminals should be forced to have this operation? Should violent content be removed from video games, movies, and TV (why or why not)? Be prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class 7.2 Attraction &amp; Altruism Why do I like you? Let me count the ways: We often like people for whom we have suffered. We like people more after we have done small favours for them. We like people best whose (accidentally over­heard) descriptions of us begin on a negative note and end with a posi­tive tone. We like people who convert to our point of view better than we like people who have agreed with us all along. We like highly competent people better after they have committed a blunder. Culture &amp; Attraction The characteristics that are attractive in the opposite sex, as well as the impor­tance of physical attractiveness, are different in different cultures. Deborah Stiles and her colleagues found that Mexican adolescents valued liking children, helping others, high intelligence, and inner goodness and honesty in their oppo­site-sex ideal. American adolescents gave higher ratings to having a lot of money, being fun, popular, good looking, and sexy. Karen Dion and her colleagues found that physical attractiveness is more impor­tant in a culture where individualism (Canadian) rather than collectivism (Chinese) is valued. David Buss and 49 collaborators in 33 countries asked young men and women (average age 23 years) about the attributes they looked for in potential mates. The researchers found many differences among cultures. The most pervasive difference they found was the emphasis given to “traditional” versus “modern” attributes. Young people looking for a mate in, and place great value on the traditional attributes of chastity, home and children, domestic skills, and providing for the family. At the other extreme, in the , , , and , young people looking for mates did not consider these attributes very important. Canadian and American values were in between these extremes. American young people differed from the international average by placing a higher value on a college degree, earning capacity, heredity, and “an exciting personality.” They placed a relatively low value on housekeeping skills, and intelligence (Buss, 1990). Without this kind of information it would be easy for us to assume that people in other cultures look for the same qualities in their potential mates as we do. (adapted from Understanding Human Behavior by Ronald Philipchalk) Culture &amp; Altruism Ronald Johnson and George Danko (1989) report significant differences in altru­ism between cultures in , , , , the , and . Benjamin Colby reports that differences in altruism between stu­dents from 133 different cultures were predictive of their ability to adapt to university culture (altruistic students adapted better). In one study Wegner and Crano found that racial fac­tors affected helping behavior. An exper­i­menter who was apparently engrossed in examining a deck of 500 computer cards approached naive subjects. Approximately one step away from the subject, the experimenter “accidentally” dropped the entire deck. Blacks helped whites 17 percent of the time but they helped blacks 75 percent of the time. Whites helped both whites and blacks 44 percent of the time. Note: Cross-cultural research seems particularly relevant to the topic of helping in that Jesus point in the parable of the “Good Samaritan” was that cultural enemies, Jews and Samaritans, should love and help each other Altruism &amp; Religion The study of altruism or helping behavior also yields some interesting results with regard to the effects of religion. Research has consistently found that only a minority of people will stop to help someone who is clearly in need, especially if they are in a hurry themselves. Darley and Batson (1973) found that this was true even for seminary students, and even when they were on their way to give a talk on the Good Samaritan. Furthermore, they found that the most “religiously devout” were the least sensitive to the victims needs; when they did offer help, they often forced it on the victim even when he or she insisted on being left alone. Batson and Gray (1981) also found that the religiously devout tended to offer help when it was not wanted. Apparently if religion makes a difference it is not always good. On the other hand, it should be noted that although only a minority of the seminarians stopped to help, they were all on their way to help the experimenter by giving a talk. Thus it was not a matter of helping or not, but a choice between which to help. If they stopped, they were led to believe, they would be late, and might endanger their ability to be of help to the experimenter. In another setting, Perry London (1970) found Christian teaching often played a role in the justification given by those who helped hide Jews from the Nazis during World War II. Further research is needed before the role of religiousness in helping behavior can be determined. (adapted from Psychology and Christianity by Ronald Philipchalk, pp. 219-220) Activity: Read and Reflect What is it that makes you think that someone is attractive, kind, evil, competent, upset, and the like? These resources will look at some of the factors that contribute to how you judge others and yourself. The first article outlines some of the ways your face has shaped your social experiences. The second article adds to this discussion by looking at how willing people are to acknowledge the role of attractiveness in their own thought processes and decision-making. Next, the topic shifts to altruism. The first of these articles proposes that only reciprocal altruism exists. Again, I would encourage you to read this article through the lens of, “Is it truly possible to know another’s motivation or intention?” Lastly, Random Acts of Kindness is a website that offers great resources and opportunities to increase kindness in your, and others, lives. I encourage you to participate in some of these activities to see how it makes you feel.

"],["health.html", "Unit 8 Health Overview 8.1 Biology of Emotion 8.2 Communicating Emotion 8.3 Experiencing Emotion 8.4 What is the Proper Role of Emotion? Assessment Checking your Learning", " Unit 8 Health Overview In Unit 8, you will examine what factors contribute to one’s general health. In Unit 9 you will gain more insight into stress and coping. Together, Units 8 and 9 span information from Chapter14 in your textbook, giving you a broad overview of the field of health psychology. Health psychologists study both positive and negative impacts that humans’ behaviour and decisions have on their health, survival, and well-being. The need for this field has increased considerably over the 20th century, as most premature deaths are attributable to lifestyle factors. Over this chapter you will gain knowledge about the interaction of all the levels of analysis (biological, psychological, sociocultural, and spiritual) with regards to your health. You will learn about the biological/physiological responses to stress and how a poor response to stress leaves a person more vulnerable to illness and slowing recovery time from illness and injury. How having at least some degree of control helps people with coping and outlook. When control is threatened, people use compensatory responses, such as detecting order within random images. You will also be informed that coping using a positive or negative style is related to personality (e.g., optimism versus pessimism). And, that positive coping increases resilience—the ability to recover from adversity, and even benefit from the experience, as is the case with post-traumatic growth. Whereas, coping via negative affectivity and pessimism can have both psychological and physiological disadvantages. Lastly, you’ll be advised as to how religion/spirituality, relaxation techniques, meditation, and biofeedback actually help people cope with stress and problems which can lead to human flourishing. Topics This unit is divided into the following topics: Biology of Emotion Communicating Emotion Experiencing Emotion Learning Outcomes By the end of this unit, student’s will be able to: Define, and apply, the key terminology related to health psychology, stress and illness, and coping and well-being. Explain how genetic and environmental factors influence obesity, how physiological reactions that occur under stress, and how the immune system is connected to stress responses. Apply your knowledge of persuasion and health to examine the effectiveness of different types of cigarette warnings, and of the beneficial effects of optimism to help you reframe stressful situations as positive opportunities. Analyze whether media depictions of smoking affect smoking in adolescents, the claim that ulcers are caused by stress, and whether activities such as relaxation techniques, meditation, and biofeedback actually help people cope with stress and problems. Describe how control over the environment and positive and negative styles of coping influences well-being.

Of course, we all have Embarrassment is a good example for trying to sepa­rate biological, psychological, and social elements of an emotion. These correspond to blushing (biological), feeling embarrassed (psychological), and violation of a social norm (social). Now back to your embarrassing moment: Which came first, blushing, feeling embarrassed, awareness of your faux pas? Which followed next? Last? The close connection between our minds and our bodies usually makes it difficult to tell whether our bodily emotional response comes before or after our psychological emotional response. This is why even psychologists have disagreed on whether you run from danger because you are afraid, or are afraid because you are running from danger. Lie Detectors The close connection between mind and body is the basis for so-called “lie-detectors.” Of course, they do not detect lies but physical responses to cognitive information. While their “hit” rate is better than a coin toss, lie detectors can accuse the in­nocent and vindicate the guilty. Moreover, some experts claim there are simple techniques for beating the ma­chine. Activity: Read and Reflect What do you think…could you beat a lie detector device? This activity will allow you to delve more deeply into the physiological aspects of human emotion (though, cognitions and behaviours do influence physiological processes) and how they can be monitored using a polygraph machine. To learn more about Lie Detectors, follow the link below: How Lie Detectors Work The reason polygraph machines can work better than flipping a coin is because they are measuring responses that often occur automatically and can be difficult, though not impossible, to bring under voluntary control. Activity: Question for Consideration Take a moment to consider what you have learned and reflect on the following question: How many ancient or old-fashioned methods for telling if someone is lying can you find on the internet? Often a person’s life depended on these highly questionable methods. Be prepared to share your thoughts with other members of the class 8.2 Communicating Emotion By now you know something about the physical responses involved in emotions, and you have given some thought to our responses to our emotions. However, a very important part of the study of emotions is the way that we communicate them. “I feel angry,” we say. But the way we say it also carries a message. Just stop for a minute and think about how many different ways (“channels” communication experts call them) we use to communicate emotions. We use our faces, our bodies, the tone and volume of our voice; in writing we use words but we also use punctuation marks (). And what about e-mail? How many ways can you find that we use to show our emotions in e-mail? (Hint: What are emoticons?) How Many Facial Expressions? The study of emotion has long been linked with the study of facial expressions. Psychologists have been interested in the way in which people express emotion and whether these facial expressions reliably convey the emotional message. Stud­ies by Ekman and others have raised a contemporary interest in emotional expression. It appears that there are some universal aspects of emotion across a number of cul­tures. Seven emotions have been consistently identified: happi­ness, sadness, anger, disgust, contempt, fear, and surprise. However, questions remain about whether this is a complete spectrum of emotion and whether there are cul­ture-specific aspects of facial emotion expression. What can you find on the internet concerning the number of possible facial emotional expressions? Activity: Read and Reflect Is there a practical use to understanding how we communicate emotions? Yes, actually there are several possible uses. One very interesting use is in the understanding of deception. For as long as we have records, we know that people have understood that liars don’t seem to be able to control all of their communication channels. Verbally, they deny they are lying, but the truth screams out from eye movements; a slightly irregular smile, a faint blush…. This activity provides additional information for your consideration: Body Language Speaks Volumes Catching a Liar 10 Reasons Why You Should Smile Another possible use of understanding emotional communication better is the development of computers that can read human emotions from speech or facial expressions. This would enable far better communication between computers and their human masters. Activity: Question for Consideration Consider what you have learned in this section - reflect on the following question: Do you think that people make distinctive facial expressions when they lie? Give your answer, and an example if you can. Be prepared to share your thoughts with other members of the class 8.3 Experiencing Emotion Now that you understand what’s happening inside your body when you are angry or embarrassed, or experiencing some other emotion, maybe you can see why we often find it so hard to control our emotions. Of course this leads to the question “Should we try to control our emotions?” Or should we just accept them as natural and inevitable? What is the proper role of emotions in our life? For example, imagine you are angry, very angry. Should you suppress and deny your anger out of fear of what you might do? Or should you “blow off steam” and freely express your true feelings? Consider the following arguments (adapted from Philipchalk,1988, p.114 ff): 8.4 What is the Proper Role of Emotion? No Role It is not hard to see that emotions are not only frequently unpleasant, but are also a source of conflict. Anger causes us to say things we later regret; fear of others inhibits our honesty; and even anticipated happiness may blind us to the harmful effects of our actions. We speak of being “swayed by our emotions,” indicating they caused us to do or say something we wouldn’t have done otherwise. Emotions are often unpredictable, making it difficult to arm ourselves against them. They vary with our physical and mental condition, with the amount of sleep we’ve had, our blood sugar level, and a host of environmental factors. They have a clear physiological “animal-like” component. And they are part of our fallen nature. Paul warns us, “Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires” (Gal. 5:24). No doubt Paul recognized that emotions arising from our physical bodies frequently play an important role in leading us to “practice the very evil that I (we) do not wish” (Rom. 7:19). Surely such an unpredictable and potentially dangerous influence should be discounted in favor of our more God-like rational faculties; isn’t the “cool intellect” superior to the “hot-head?” Furthermore, since emotions are such an elusive and private matter, the direction they give to behavior is easily misinterpreted, sometimes with disastrous results. For example, we might misinterpret physiological arousal as attraction. (Psychologists Dutton and Aron (1970) found that male subjects meeting an attractive woman on a high bridge felt more attracted to her than subjects meeting her on a lower bridge). Or we might misinterpret our physical attraction as love. (Psychiatrist Scott Peck (1978) argues that the experience of “falling in love” is inevitably sexual). Particularly important for Christians is the danger of misinterpreting an emotional response as the voice of God. Some Christians frequently attempt to determine God’s will by looking for an inner feeling. They may even base life-changing decisions on fleeting inner impressions of peace, unsettledness, or excitement. This can be extremely dangerous. Such feeling may be little more than expressions of their own inner wishes or fears, or simply physiological arousal that has been mislabeled. To summarize, emotions are unreliable, easily misinterpreted, and a tool for possible manipulation. They are deeply rooted in our animal-likeness—our physical bodies. As such they should be brought into subjection and perhaps ignored or entirely minimized. In short, it would appear from these considerations that emotions should have no legitimate role in the regulation of behavior. Important Role The first thing to note with regard to the importance of emotion is that they appear to be part of God’s design for us. God has chosen to form us as emotional beings as well as rational and volitional ones. Although we are fallen, and therefore our capacities of thought and will, as well as our emotional responses, are imperfect, we are created in God’s image nevertheless. The bible ascribes emotions to God. Although some people may dismiss these references as anthropomorphisms, God certainly acts as thought He felt emotions like anger, sadness, and joy. Furthermore, Jesus took on an emotion-feeling body, and expressed a full range of emotions (possibly more than most men in contemporary Western culture). In addition, the fruit of the Spirit (Gal. 5:22-23) includes several blessings with strong emotional components (e.g., joy, peace). Whatever their weaknesses, emotions cannot be dismissed as wholly sinful. One of the important early findings of modern psychology was the discovery that emotions must not be completely ignored. To deny and suppress them is to court harm. This does not mean that we should give free expression to every feeling we have. Psychological health doesn’t require that we blowup in anger every time that someone crosses us. But neither should we deny, especially to ourselves, that we are angry. Anger can be redirected to constructive ends; it can be controlled through cognitive strategies such as refusing to dwell on the situation that produced it. The Apostle Paul seems to take a similar position when he says, “Be angry and yet do not sin” (Eph. 4:26), indicating that while anger is probably inevitable, the sinful response in thought or behavior is not. Of course there is a positive side to emotions. They provide the flavor, the resonance, the texture, and the color in an otherwise dull existence. One of the main features that distinguish a person from a machine, which might be capable of many human feats, is the person’s sentient or feeling ability, the person’s capacity to experience emotion. Emotions are the source of much that is pleasant and good in life. Christians find joy and peace in serving God. Even so-called negative emotions have their value. We can direct hatred towards evil; anger can motivate us to overcome injustice; and fear can drive us to God. Thus emotions are an inevitable part of the God-ordained human condition. They provide the highs as well as the lows in our experience, and their recognition (although not necessarily their uncontrolled expression) is necessary for our health. Although they may frequently lead us astray, and may potentially be the source of unwanted influence, we are fallen creatures, and our other faculties, rational and volitional, are also imperfect. Emotions must be trained. As C.S. Lewis noted, we must be educated to “feel pleasure, liking, disgust, and hatred at those things which really are pleasant, likable, disgusting, and hateful” (The Abolition of Man, [1943] 1978, p.15). For Lewis, trained emotion not the lack of emotion is the essential mark of the virtuous person. The maturing person will show greater and greater appropriate emotionality. Despite controversy at the theoretical level concerning the exact relationship between our thoughts and other components of emotions, the work of Stanley Schacter and Jerome Singer - see Schachter-Singer Theory of Emotion has clearly indicated the importance of mental responses. We probably have the potential for a great deal more control over our emotions than we usually admit. Activity: Read and Reflect How well do you handle your emotions?

"],["stress-and-coping.html", "Unit 9 Stress and Coping Overview 9.1 Stress 9.2 Aggression, Submission, and Assertion 9.3 Health Psychology Assessment Checking your Learning", " Unit 9 Stress and Coping Overview In Unit 9, you will gain more insight into stress and coping. Together, Units 8 and 9 span information from Chapter 14 in your textbook, giving you a broad overview of the field of health psychology. Health psychologists study both positive and negative impacts that humans’ behaviour and decisions have on their health, survival, and well-being. The need for this field has increased considerably over the 20th century, as most premature deaths are attributable to lifestyle factors. Over this chapter you will gain knowledge about the interaction of all the levels of analysis (biological, psychological, sociocultural, and spiritual) with regards to your health. You will learn about the biological/physiological responses to stress and how a poor response to stress leaves a person more vulnerable to illness and slowing recovery time from illness and injury. You will also see how having at least some degree of control helps people with coping and outlook. When control is threatened, people use compensatory responses, such as detecting order within random images. You will also be informed that coping, using a positive or negative style, is related to personality (e.g., optimism versus pessimism). Positive coping increases resilience—the ability to recover from adversity, and even benefit from the experience, as is the case with post-traumatic growth. Whereas, coping via negative affectivity and pessimism can have both psychological and physiological disadvantages. Finally, you will be advised as to how religion/spirituality, relaxation techniques, meditation, and biofeedback actually help people cope with stress and problems which can lead to human flourishing.

(2024). Revel for An Introduction to Psychological Science, 4th Canadian Edition. Pearson Ed. Other resources will be provided online. 9.1 Stress Many health professionals and researchers have devised scales to measure stress. For some of these you might check out: Teach Health This site also contains useful information on stress. Stress is a popular topic, so you will find lots of information on the internet; for example, you can find tips on reducing stress at: Caring for Your Mental Health Many experts suggest meditation as a way to reduce stress. If you would like to investigate the topic of Christians and meditation further, I would encourage you to look into the Insight Timer app at: Insight Timer Insighttimer.com also has some excellent general meditation resources for improving one’s health over a number of different domains. 9.2 Aggression, Submission, and Assertion Much of the stress we experience comes from problems we have with other peo¬ple. Unfortunately, many people see only two alternatives in dealing with interper¬sonal conflict: aggression or submission. Are there other ways? Assertiveness represents a third alternative but one that is often confused with aggression. Assertive statements are not attacks. Rather, they communi¬cate one’s own perceptions and emotions. Such responses often take the form of “I-statements”: I feel _________ when you do _________. Being assertive tends to defuse conflict situations because it gives both parties more complete information to work with—so it helps alleviate stress. Activity: Personal Reflection Now that you have some understanding concerning the differences between aggression, submission, and assertion, look at the situations below and devise all three kinds of responses to each one. Be prepared to share your insights with other members of the class Situation #1: Someone is crowding in front of you in line at the grocery store. Aggressive Response: _________________ Submissive Response: _________________ Assertive Response: _________________ Situation #2: After a physical exam the doctor gives you a prescription without telling you what the diagnosis is, what the medicine is for, or what the side effects might be. When you ask for this information, the doctor brushes off your question. Aggressive Response: _________________ Submissive Response: _________________ Assertive Response: _________________ Situation #3: A boyfriend or girlfriend wants to end your relationship. Aggressive Response: _________________ Submissive Response: _________________ Assertive Response: _________________ Situation #4: The boss tells you that your work has been of poor quality and that you will shape up or be fired. Aggressive Response: _________________ Submissive Response: _________________ Assertive Response: _________________ Situation #5: You have received a grade that is much lower than you feel you deserved on an essay examination.* Aggressive Response: _________________ Submissive Response: _________________ Assertive Response: _________________ Finally, consider the following: Are any of your responses affected by your religious beliefs? How so? Activity: Questions for Consideration Consider the following question - how does it connect to what you have learned in this section: Each of us has some minor annoyances that add to our stress level more than they should. What gets you stressed out? What are your everyday “pet peeves” (annoyances)? Does the stress that these things produce seem justified? What are some things you can do to decreases your stress responses to these situations? Be prepared to share your thoughts with other members of the class 9.3 Health Psychology As mentioned in the Overview, health psychologists study both positive and negative impacts that humans’ behaviour and decisions have on their health, survival, and well-being. Below are a couple of examples describing the impact of having some form of reward that perpetuates the use of a behaviour (whether healthy or unhealthy) and the power of remaining committed to making the changes you want to see. A primary concern of health psychology is not to find new cures, but to get peo­ple to use the solutions that are available. Smoking, drug use, overeating, and gambling are just some of the destructive behaviors in which people engage be­cause they say they don’t have the willpower to quit. We might say because they want to engage in them. Why? Generally, we have to conclude that there are rewards for engaging in these behaviors. You might want to examine some of your behaviors, especially ones that could be considered “maladaptive”, in light of what rewards are maintaining them. E. Scott Geller has written extensively in the area of motivating healthful behav­ior. His research covers alcohol use, driving while impaired, highway safety, and seat belt use. For several years he has personally carried on a campaign to get air­lines to make a seat belt announcement at the end of each flight (Geller, 1989). Sometime during the flight Geller gives a pilot or flight attendant a small card. In addition to attractive graphics, the card contains the following message: Airline Announcement - Now that you have worn a seat belt for the safest part of your trip, the flight crew would like to remind you to buckle-up during your ground transportation. Geller reports that in one 4 1/2 year time period, for 33.7 percent of the flights on which he gave out this card, the requested announcement was made. Some air­lines even made the buckle-up reminder a regular part of their end-of-flight an­nouncements. On the other hand, one airline distributed a memo to its staff stating “ignore the request of the Virginia Tech professor with the blue card.” Geller had his cards reprinted on yellow stock and continued to distribute the requests! Geller, E. S. (1989). The airline lifesaver: In pursuit of small wins. Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 22(3) This summary of Geller’s past activities demonstrates that with motivation and persistence, you can change not only your own behaviours, but also, those of large corporations. If you have been on an airplane recently, you have likely noticed that the universally communicated announcement to have your seatbelt fastened during landing and transport back to the terminal. Activity: Read and Reflect In this activity you will watch Dr. Kelly McGonigal’s TED talk titled, “How to Make Stress your Friend.” This video is groundbreaking research to help people transform their perspective on stress: After watching the video, take a few minutes to read about Dr. Gil Greengross’ research that challenges the widely held belief that humour is good for your health.

(2024). Revel for An Introduction to Psychological Science, 4th Canadian Edition. Pearson Ed. Other resources will be provided online. 10.1 Looking at What is Normal and Anxiety Disorders We begin this topic by considering the following excerpt: I avoid it whenever I can. In fact, I fear those days in which I have to experience it—going to the dentist. I know this is a common fear, but the reason for my fear is different from most people’s. When I go to the dentist, I pace back and forth in the waiting room, my heart races, I start to sweat and I have some trouble breathing. I know some people have problems with needles, or drills—not so for me. You see, my problem is with X-rays. I know, you are probably thinking, “what could be the problem with x-rays—this guy must really be a baby”. Well, the problem is that I have one of the strongest gag reflexes that my dentist has ever seen (at least so he tells me). When the dentist puts the lead backing in my mouth (you know the cardboard thing that makes sure you don’t get cancer, or brain damage, or produce deformed children–at least this is what my dentist tells me), I choke on the piece and gag it up. In addition to being terribly uncomfortable, it is highly embarrassing—not to mention a little scary for all those children in the waiting room listening to the guy “dying” in the dentist’s chair. My dentist has tried everything—cutting the backing so it is smaller, having a nurse talk to me to distract my attention, having a nurse down the hall flip the X-ray switch as soon as the backing is in my mouth. Nothing seems to work, and over the past 20 years of going to the dentist, I have become more and more anxious with the experience. Only one solution has seemed to work—letting me put the backing in my mouth myself and taking the picture really fast. (TWU psychology professor, personal communication)* What is Normal? As the textbook points out, the definition of what is normal varies depending on culture and circumstances. As you read about various disorders, you may be struck by how similar “disordered” behavior is to normal behavior. (You should also beware of the “medical student syndrome;” the tendency to feel you have the problem you are studying.) In fact, disordered thought and behavior is usually just exaggerated normal behavior perhaps displayed at inappropriate times. For example, how would you diagnose someone who walks back and forth waving his arms and shouting one minute, and sits down and weeps uncontrollably the next? You might think he had a serious mental problem…*that is until you found out he was a basketball coach on the sidelines of a big game Here is a list of comparisons between normal personality characteristics on the left, and the same type of behavior classified as a personality disorder on the right (originally published in Harper’s, February 1997, by L.J. Davis). You will learn more about personality disorders in a later section, but for now, you can probably see that the right, “disordered” column could just represent a different perspective on the left, “normal” column: image of chart listing of personality style and personality disorder This is not to say that psychological diagnoses have no validity. The point is that diagnosis is difficult and sometimes controversial. Activity: Read and Reflect The following articles augment your understanding of the descriptions of the disorders discussed in the textbook and provide opportunity to understand more about anxiety disorders. Due to the pervasiveness of disorders, especially anxiety related problems, this information could prove invaluable in helping yourself and others find hope and help in challenging circumstances. There is also an excellent write up on the many valid criticisms of being overly dependent on the DSM as a resource. Psychological Problems and Disorders Anxiety Disorders Criticism of America’s Diagnostic Bible- The DSM Activity: Questions for Consideration Consider what you have learned in this section. Use the following questions to guide your reflection: Would you expect Christians to be more mentally healthy than non-Christians? Why or why not? What about people with other religious/spiritual beliefs? What about people with no religious/spiritual beliefs? Be prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class 10.2 Mood Disorders Before we consider mood disorders, take moment to read through the following case: Jane (not her real name) was a married church-going woman. She seemed to live a normal, uneventful life. Her family, however, was living a private hell. At times, Jane would be so depressed that she didn’t want to get out of bed. She would mope around the house. She didn’t want to see anyone or visit anyone. Her children and husband tried to lift her spirits, but their efforts were all in vain. She believed she was worthless, useless, and her life was meaningless. At other times, Jane was the life of the party. She would make great plans to change the world. She would give huge sums of money to charity and she would go on pointless, spending frenzies. Her husband was forced to cancel their credit cards for fear of personal bankruptcy. When Jane found out about the cards being cancelled she reacted violently. She told her husband that he was old, ugly and worthless, and that she could be with anyone she wanted. In fact, she stated that all the young men are staring at her—“If I wasn’t a committed Christian, I’d be leave you to be with one of those young men, they all want me.” Her family could no longer stand Jane’s mood swings—she was either “pathetic” or “unbearable”. After years of mood fluctuations, Jane was finally diagnosed as suffering from Bipolar Mood Disorder. Following medical treatment and counselling, Jane’s moods stabilized and the family was again able to live peacefully. 10.3 Depression Depression is one of the most common psychological problems of all—striking Christians and non-Christians alike. Mental health workers sometimes refer to it as “the common cold” of psychological disorders. In depression we once again see the link between normal and abnormal behavior. We all feel sad or down sometimes. A diagnosis of depression, however, is an extreme and continuing sadness. You will see more about the criteria for this diagnosis in the textbook and the online resources. 10.4 Heartsick *Depression Hurts the Heart Experts have long thought depression could be bad for your heart. A new study demonstrates just how dangerous it can be. Brenda Penninx, a gerontologist at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., and colleagues followed 2,847 people over 55—both with and without heart disease—for four years to trace the effects of depression. In the end, people with major depression were at least three times as likely as patients who were not depressed to die of heart disease. Even subjects with mild depression experienced a fatality rate that was 50 percent higher than normal. Penninx isn’t sure exactly what the connection is, but since depression can raise stress, and stress triggers an outpouring of the hormone cortisol, this could cause heart rate and blood pressure to rise. Other factors could play a part: Depressed people are less likely to exercise or eat right than those who don’t suffer from the malady. “Depression deserves a lot more attention than it usually gets,” Penninx warns. “It’s a huge cardiac risk factor, so it’s crucial to take care of your emotions.”“ —Health (Quoted in Readers Digest, Feb. 2002, p. 27)* Activity: Read and Reflect How do you know the difference between depression and normal sadness? In this activity, you are given an overview of depression that explains the causes, describes the diagnostic criteria, and offers some treatment options. Additionally, though children may suffer from a disorder, there are additional challenges in noticing it in them due to their immature language, cognitive, and emotion processing abilities and developmental stage. The second resource provides an overview of recognizing the signs that a child is struggling due to a disorder. Information about Depression Mental Illness in Children Activity: Questions for Consideration Consider the how the following questions relate to what you have learned in this section: Can you think of some examples of biblical characters that apparently suffered from a mood disorder? Describe their behavior? What do their examples suggest about possible causes? (Hint: Elijah, David, Saul, others?) If you are not familiar with biblical personages, give an example from literature or contemporary public life. Be prepared to share your thoughts with other members of the class 10.5 Schizophrenia Schizophrenia is one of the more devastating psychological illnesses. Schizophrenia is not common, however, it seems to be universal, appearing in cultures all over the world and across history. Some of our earliest writings describe people who seem to have lost touch with reality, who “hear voices,” and who produce bizarre speech and behaviours. At some earlier times in history, a person experiencing such symptoms may have been suspected of demon possession or some form of witchcraft. At other times and places, such people might be revered as shamans or as having special connections to the spirit world, and may well have played important roles in the community. Importantly, spiritual contributions to schizophrenia’s symptoms are still considered in some religious and cultural interpretations of this disorder. Schizophrenia in the Bible But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him. And he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses; they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till he knew that the Most High God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will. Daniel 5:20-21 The bible gives relatively few accounts of people troubled by mental illness as we would call it today. The above account is of Belshazar, son of Nebuchadnezzar who was killed after losing his metal faculties. Interestingly, his father, Nebuchadnezzzar seemed to suffer from a similar loss of functioning: O King Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken, The kingdom is departed from thee. And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; they shall make thee to eat grass like oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kngdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will. The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar, and he was driven from men, and did eat grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles’ feathers, and his nails like birds’ claws. Daniel, 4:31b-33 The Split in Schizophrenia This strange behavior and apparent loss of contact with reality we would probably consider schizophrenia today. Schizophrenia appears in all cultures at about the same rate. Schizophrenia is one of the most serious and debilitating of the psychological disorders. As mentioned in the textbook, schizophrenia is often confused with dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder, popularly known as split personality). Schizophrenics do not have a split personality. And it is not correct to refer to someone with a “split personality” as schizophrenic. The “split” (schism) that schizophrenics experience is a split from reality. Schizophrenics may suffer from disorganized thought, paranoid delusions, hallucinations, and many other unusual thought patterns. Activity: Read and Reflect Schizophrenia is a truly fascinating condition that continues to draw much attention. This activity presents current in-depth research and general information concerning schizophrenia that will illuminate the complexity of the development and treatment of this disorder. Schizophrenia Activity: Question for Consideration Take a moment to reflec on what you have learned using the question below: Before the development of modern psychology, how do you think people suffering from schizophrenia were treated? How much better is treatment today? Be prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class. 10.6 Personality Disorders Personality disorders are relatively common disorders where the person can function normally, but shows evidence of some difficulty or abnormality in social functioning. Unlike other disorders, the person does not seem to feel there is a difficulty. Antisocial Personality Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD) is a pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others. It can be seen in individuals who have a profound lack of empathy or emotional connection with others, a disregard for others’ rights or preferences, and a tendency toward imposing their own desires, often violently, onto others regardless of the consequences for other people or, often when younger, other animals. APD (sometimes referred to as psychopathy) tends to be highly resistant to treatment, in part because individuals with APD are not alarmed or distressed by their actions (although others frequently are), and they are thus rarely, if ever, motivated to change. The following is a short example to illustrate how some people who suffer from APD might present themselves: A former professor at UBC, Dr. Robert Hare (an internationally known expert on antisocial personality disorders) often conducted research with prisoners diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder. He frequently took graduate students with him to prison to assist in this research. To illustrate the ability of the prisoners to “con” even bright graduate students, he told them that on the way back from prison inevitably the students would tell him that the prisoner they had been dealing with was innocent. They were sure there had been a mistake, and the prisoner had been falsely convicted. Such is the charm and persuasive power of the antisocial personality. Activity: Read and Reflect Recall from Chapter 12 that our personalities allow others to predict and anticipate our responses to situations. A person with a “healthy” personality demonstrates a range of coping responses and styles when placed in a stressful situation. However, a disordered personality does not have this kind of adaptability and flexibility. At times, the person doesn’t feel they like they have any problems, at other times, the lack of adaptability and the limited repertoire of coping responses can result in distress for the person and for those around him or her. In this activity, you can gain more insight into defined patterns of personality disorders.

These therapies are generally contrasted with biomedical approaches, which deal more with the biological world of the individual. Biomedical therapies focus on altering a person’s biology to effect a change in the person’s psychology. Eclectic Approach The eclectic approach is an approach that values the diversity of treatment approaches. Eclectic approaches deal with psychology and biology. In addition, various types of psychotherapies may be employed. Eclectic therapy approaches are becoming very popular. A Sin Problem? *“Many Christians are not satisfied with viewing psychological disorders as either illnesses or nothing but thought and behavior problems. They feel that both of these approaches are inadequate because they omit very important moral and spiritual questions. Consequently, the important issue of moral responsibility is not dealt with adequately. They feel that since humanity’s most basic problem is alienation from God as a result of sin, no other difficulty can be dealt with until the relationship with God has been restored. Thus the first goal of therapy is to bring the client to the place of acknowledging his or her need, and asking for divine forgiveness through Jesus Christ. Once the client has placed his or her trust in God, and is operating within the same religious conceptual framework as the therapist, therapy can then proceed to the identification of specific disturbances of thought and behavior. These are seen as examples of sin in that the individual is either acting in a sinful way towards others, or is harboring sinful thoughts and attitudes within. The therapist will assist the individual to identify, confess, and forsake these sins. The goal of therapy is seen primarily in terms of spiritual growth and a “closer walk with God.”* Sin Only? In a work for Christian counselors, Koteskey (1983) gives the example of his eighteen month old son who developed an intense fear of dogs after two unpleasant experiences with them. Even the fact that the child was too young to talk did not prevent a fellow Christian psychologist from concluding that he had a spiritual problem. We should recognize that not every problem is necessarily a spiritual one. Just as a disturbance may have a purely biological cause, so too it may have a simple psychological (learning) explanation. Information gained from the study of animals may be helpful in the understanding of psychological problems as it is often vital in understanding biological problems. (Both excerpts from Psychology and Christianity by Ronald Philipchalk) Activity: Read and Reflect For many people unfamiliar with the journey of counselling, finding suitable resources may feel daunting. It is important to know that there are many different approaches designed to help you accomplish the growth goals you have for your life. In this activity, the first resource, Psych Central is the oldest peer-reviewed psychology and mental health network on the Internet. Established in 1992, originally it was an index to mental health. Now it gives you the opportunity to see some treatment options for a wide variety of conditions. Additionally, there is a resource on different theoretical approaches to behavior change, and a link to some information concerning the integration of Christianity and psychotherapy. PsychCentral Behaviour Online Integration Models Activity: Questions for Consideration Read the questions below and consider how they connect to what you have learned: What is your view of the role of sin (or questionable moral behaviours) or other religious/spiritual beliefs in the treatment of psychological disorders? What kinds of religious/spiritual beliefs could lead to greater feelings of guilt/shame and increased psychological disorder? Be prepared to share your thoughts with other members of the class. Assessment Refer to the course schedule for graded assignments you are responsible for submitting. All graded assignments, and their due dates, can be found on the “Assessment” tab.

Our final unit expands upon Unit 11 and introduces the exciting, and ever expanding, world of therapy. Today, psychotherapeutic techniques are used to address a range of human conditions, from helping people find hope in overwhelmingly challenging circumstances to people exploring ways to optimize their potentials. Having a therapeutic relationship can be tremendously valuable in a person’s life as a therapist should be non-judgmental and have no other agenda than to help a person reach their therapeutic goals. This final unit of the course will continue to build upon Unit 11 by discussing the effectiveness of therapy, some of the biological treatment options, and some tips on preventing problems. Topics This unit will be divided into the following topics: Evaluating Therapy Biological Treatments Preventing Problems Learning Outcomes By the end of this unit, student’s will be able to: Define the key terminology associated with mental health treatment, psychological therapies, and biological treatments. Describe the major barriers to seeking help for psychological disorders, arguments for and against involuntary treatment, and general approaches to conducting major types of psychotherapy. Apply your knowledge to suggest what approach to therapy is likely most appropriate for a given situation, to identify major therapeutic techniques, and which drug therapies could be used for different psychological conditions. Analyze whether self-help options, such as popular books, are a useful therapy option, the pros and cons of the major types of psychotherapy and whether St. John’s Wort, a popular herbal remedy for depression, works. Describe how the drugs described in this module, and the other major medical approaches to therapy, affect brain functioning.

(2024). Revel for An Introduction to Psychological Science, 4th Canadian Edition. Pearson Ed. Other resources will be provided online. 12.1 Evaluating Therapy Therapy? In a previous chapter, we looked at various ways of understanding personality. In the first part of this chapter we have been considering different therapies that grow out of these personality theories. Now it is time to ask the question, “Does it work? Is psychotherapy effective?” The answer seems to be “Yes,” but there are qualifications. First, many people who do not receive treatment get better anyway. And second, placebo treatments also produce improvements, as do non-professional caring relationships. As David Myers says, “All types of psychotherapy seem to offer three benefits: new hope, a fresh perspective, and an empathic, trusting, caring relationship.” (p. 592) When you stop and think about it, isn’t this what a good friend offers? Maybe if we all experienced (and offered) this kind of friendship, therapists wouldn’t be so much in demand. Therapy in Other Cultures The process of psychotherapy generally assumes a cultural value of sharing your inner feelings and problems with another individual. David Ho observes that in the culture of Hong Kong, it is a sign of weakness to talk about one’s problems and to reveal much of one’s self. This cultural background influences the style of therapy and the process of psychotherapy. How would you proceed if you were a therapist? Paul Pedersen (1985; 1987; 2000) suggests that we do not need to look at cultures outside North America to see differences in the process of psychotherapy. He sug­gests that different sub cultural minorities within North America approach psy­chotherapy with different values and different expectations. Native North American cultures, Asian immigrants, Hispanics, and Afro-Americans have different approaches to the pro­cess of psychotherapy. A therapist needs to be aware of these cultural differ­ences to perform effectively in the therapeutic situation. Activity: Read and Reflect As mentioned earlier, this activity gives you an opportunity to explore the American Psychological Association (APA) website. In many ways, the APA leads the discipline and profession of psychology. It is an excellent resource for finding information on a number of areas of psychology, contemporary issues in psychology, a plethora of resources for self-help. They also have the opportunity for students to become student affiliates and enjoy member privileges that will contribute to your development as a professional. Follow the link below: American Psychological Association Activity: Question for Consideration Consider the following: Do you think an empathic, trusting, caring friend could be as effective as a trained psychotherapist or counselor? Be prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class 12.2 Biological Treatments Though there are a number of treatments options within the field of psychology, there are two basic treatment models: The Wellness Model The Medical Model. The Wellness Model will look intently, and holistically, at a number of areas of a person’s life (thoughts/emotions, relationships, work/academics, developmental stage, nutrition, activity/leisure, and sleep, to name a few) and illuminate the client’s strengths and resources to help them find a way to overcome challenges and lead a more fulfilling life. Many of the psychotherapeutic approaches looked at, thus far, operate on this model. The Medical Model, however, is based on symptom recognition, (differential) diagnosis, prognosis, and often a pharmacological support and possibly an invasive or non-invasive procedure. The topic of biological treatments is based on the medical model. Medical Treatments Although psychotherapy in its various forms has grown in importance over the past generation, people are still more inclined to seek the help of medical professionals over mental health professionals for their psychological concerns. One of the greatest changes in the way we have treated psychological disorders has been through the discovery and use of various drugs. In this section, we consider the various biomedical therapies that are available for psychological disorders. Not a Panacea All of the biological therapies produce side effects, some of them permanent. Since the brain cannot regenerate itself, psychosurgery is irreversible; ECT destroys brain cells, producing memory loss, some of which is permanent; virtually all drugs have side effects besides the dependency produced, and some of these are permanent. (For example, one class of antipsychotic drugs, the phenothiazines, can produce a permanent and irreversible muscle disorder, particularly after massive long-term use. This disorder, called tardive dyskinesia, is evidenced by involuntary movements of the face, limbs, and trunk.) Furthermore, the unknown basis of the effects of many of these techniques (e.g., ECT, and some drugs), and the exploratory nature of others (psychosurgery) should make us at least a little skeptical. (A further controversy surrounding the use of physiological therapies, particularly, ECT, concerns their forced administration to involuntary patients.) Activity: Read and Reflect It is important, when considering biological treatments, to receive input from more than one professional and to do adequate research on the treatment to understand the potential risks and benefits. This activity serves as a resource for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) as treatments for depression. It also has a link to explore an alternative therapy known as neurotherapy/neurofeedback, which is a safe (when administered by a well-trained professional), non-invasive option for a number of different developmental and psychological matters. To learn more, read below: Electroconvulsive Therapy and Other Depression Treatments International Society for Neuroregulation and Research Activity: Read and Reflect Consider the following questions in context of what you have learned about in this section: As biological influence in psychological disorders becomes more obvious, what are the implications for psychologists and “talk therapy?” Will biological therapies eventually replace old style talk therapies? Be prepared to share your thoughts with other members of the class 12.3 Preventing Problems A Little Help When You Need It… The textbook discusses the value of prevention on a broad level, including environmental changes. Here, we take a more personal look at how you might go about dealing with major problems or just simple blockages in your pathway to growth. We all need help from time to time, whether we get it from family, friends, or paid professionals. Professional help can be a real boost. It might be testing to clarify career directions, sharing a relationship issue with a sympathetic listener, or in-depth study of a long-term problem. A trained helper provides an objective perspective and an empathic ear. An Ounce of Prevention Being aware of the possible causes of psychological problems as well as the appropriate treatments can help you avoid similar difficulties in your own life. For example you can: Not bury and deny strong emotions (psychodynamic view) Take responsibility for your feelings &amp; promote growth (humanistic view) Associate positive consequences with desirable actions and negative results with undesirable ones (behavioral view) Avoid negative self-talk in favor of positive (cognitive view) Cultivate empathic, trusting, caring relationships Take steps to ensure a healthy body Activity: Read and Reflect Looking intently at how you are spending your time and taking preventative steps to contribute to your mental/emotional health and overall well-being is a great gift to give to yourself (and ultimately others). This activity offers a resource where you can find information on a variety of (usually research-based) preventative strategies. Moreover, if you decide that you would like to explore therapy for yourself, there are resources here to inform you as to how to find a suitable therapist and what some of your rights and responsibilities are in therapy. Psychology Help Center How to Choose a Therapist Rights and Responsibilities in Psychotherapy Activity: Questions for Consideration Consider the following questions: What role do your religious or other beliefs play in your efforts to avoid psychological difficulties and promote growth? Do your beliefs affect your choice of the kind of help you would look for? Be prepared to share your thoughts and insights with other members of the class Assessment In addition to your participation in this unit’s Learning Lab, you will also be responsible for completing Quiz #3 - more information can be found by scrolling down to the bottom of the page.

This page will provide an outline of what is expected for your Term Paper. Assignment Overview As Christians and as psychologists, it is crucial that we are able to critically evaluate psychological research. The main purpose of this assignment is to provide you with an opportunity to utilize your skills in research design and analysis as well as to practice your interpretation and critical analysis skills. You will also begin to utilize formatting guidelines specific to an academic discipline. In this case, you will use those provided by the American Psychological Association (APA). 13.1 Term Paper The first of your final assessments will be to submit a term paper. This term paper will require you to call upon information you have learned throughout the entire course - in particular, this term paper will continue to build upon the skills you applied in writing your Writing Assignment #1 and Writing Assignment #2 submissions. Additional resources will be provided at the bottom of this page - they are intended to support the development of your paper. STEP 1: Choose an Article Select one of the following topics from the course. Topics include language development, social roles and obedience, ADHD &amp; Autism, emotional intelligence, and cognitive behavioral therapy. You should familiarize yourself with the topic by browsing through the textbook and lecture notes (if we have already covered it in class). You should then search for a journal article of interest to you that falls within this topic. You should identify this article as being either a true experiment or a non-experiment. Using PSYCInfo via the TWU library website, use keywords to search for articles. More details on how to do this will be provided in class. Choose articles that you find interesting and are able to understand. Some articles can be jargon-filled and complicated, so it is in your best interest to choose one that you will be able to read and write about. STEP 2: Summarize Your Article After reading the article, you should begin to summarize the main points. Just as you would describe the study if you were having a casual conversation with someone, you should summarize the study so that it is brief and easy to understand. You should summarize the article in your own words. Copying sections from the article is considered to be plagiarism. A description of each section of an article is provided below: Introduction In their introduction, the author(s) will describe previous research. In your summary indicate the main findings of that previous research. Additionally, in the introduction the author(s) will describe the purpose of the study they conducted and how it relates to the previous research. In your summary you should identify the question that the author(s) were trying to answer and the hypotheses they were evaluating.` //todo #9 Activity Checklist Here is a checklist of learning activities you will benefit from in completing this unit.
