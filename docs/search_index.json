This book is divided into 6 units of study to help you engage with the materials. The course resources and learning activities are designed not only to help prepare you for the course assessments, but also to give you opportinities to practice various skills. Below you will find information about how to navigate this book. Please also refer the schedule in Moodle, as well as the Asseessment section in Moodle for instructions on required readings and assignments. Course Notes You should be reading this information in the context of a Trinity Western University course offered via Moodle. If this is not the case, then this may be an unauthorized reproduction of the course. Please contact elearning@twu.ca if you have concerns. These notes will be your guide through the learning activities and assessment strategies necessary for you to succeed in the course, so it is important for you to engage to the best of your ability and take advantage of the resources available to you through Trinity Western University. Assessment tasks are managed in other sections of the Moodle course, so be sure to familiarize yourself with those requirements and resources. How this Course is Built This course is primarily designed to be completed asynchronously, meaning that there are no scheduled times or places that you are required to meet, even online. You can work according to your own schedule within the six weeks you have to complete the course. That said, this is a full university level course and there are timelines that we strongly recommend that you meet to ensure that you are succeeding in building your knowledge through the course. It would be to your significant disadvantage to submit everything at the end of the course. Asynchronous courses require learners to be well-organized and self-motivated, and we have included supports for you to help you develop strong learning habits that will ensure your success. For example, there are several self-check quizzes throughout the course. These quizzes are not graded, but they can be powerful tools for you to ensure you understand key ideas and concepts. We suggest you take each quiz without the aid of your notes and textbook and multiple times until you have mastered the content. This strategy taps into three powerful learning structures that have been shown to be highly effective. Effortful recall. By intentionally trying to recall information without external aids, you are strengthening the neural pathways in your brain that lead to building new connections between ideas. One way to make recall easier is to connect key ideas to other things that you know or have experienced. For example, you might be studying World War II, and you connect the date that Canadians participated in the D-Day operation with something else meaningful to you that happened on June 6, like maybe the date you bought your first car. Spaced repetition. By spreading out your attempts on the quiz (leaving a few days between attempts) you can maximize the effects of the first strategy (effortful recall) and ensure that your second or third attempts truly reflect what you know about the topic. We suggest leaving 1-3 days between attempt 1 and 2, then 4-5 days between attempt 2 and 3. You can use a tool like Trello, Notion, or Asana (free versions), or even a task list on your phone to set up a spaced repetition schedule. Interleaving. This is the practice of studying a particular topic for a relatively short period of time (maybe 30-40 mins), then switching to a different topic for the same period, before going back to the original topic. We will help build this into your learning by including items from unit 1 in your unit 2-6 quizzes. You can also practice this by taking regular breaks in your work, or even by retaking a unit 1 quiz while you are working in unit 2. These three strategies are very effective at helping people remember key facts about a particular topic, an important first step in learning at the university level. However, you will be asked to do much more than just remember facts. Your ultimate goal is to develop evaluative judgement, or the ability for you to judge for yourself the quality of your (or your peers’) responses to prompts. The discussion forums are a key way for you to do this. We have set up the forums in such a way that you will need to present a response to any given prompt before you see other learners’ responses. We strongly encourage you to use this structure to formulate your own ideas before you present them in the forum, and then to use the responses of your peers to help you evaluate your own response. Using these self-check activities in this way is designed to help you to succeed on the course assignments, upon which your final grade will be determined. These assignments will require you to use the facts of the course to generate unique responses to the prompts, based on your past experiences, knowledge, and ability to evaluate the quality of your own work.

Course Units This course is organized into 6 units. Each unit of the course will provide you with the following information: A general overview of the key concepts that will be addressed during the unit. Specific learning outcomes and topics for the unit. Learning activities to help you engage with the concepts. These often include key readings, videos, and reflective prompts. The Assessment section provides details on assignments you will need to complete throughout the course to demonstrate your understanding of the course learning outcomes. Note that assessments, including assignments and discussion posts will be submitted in Moodle. See the Assessment tab in Moodle for the assignment dropboxes. Course Activities Below is some key information on features you will see throughout the course.  Learning Activity This box will prompt you to engage in course concepts, often by viewing resources and reflecting on your experience and/or learning. Most learning activities are ungraded and are designed to help prepare you for the assessment in this course. Assessment This box will signify an assignment or discussion post you will submit in Moodle. Note that these demonstrate your understanding of the course learning outcomes. Be sure to review the grading rubrics for each assignment. Checking Your Learning This box is for checking your understanding, to make sure you are ready for what follows. Ways to check your learning might include self-check quizzes or questions for discussion. These activities are not graded but are critical for you to be able to begin to develop evaluative judgement in this domain of knowledge. Note This box signifies key notes. It may also warn you of possible problems or pitfalls you may encounter! 0.1 The Developing Person - Part 1 Overview Now that we have covered over some broad and influential topics in psychology, we begin our focus on human development. The focus of the content for this unit, will be on Chapter 10 in your textbook. As you turn ahead, you will notice that Chapter 10 contains a large amount of information - because of this, we will be covering it in this unit, and the next (Unit 4). In this Unit (Part 1), you will learn about various strategies for researching human development, normal and abnormal prenatal development, and various cognitive, physical, and social developmental factors for infancy, childhood, and adolescence. Topics This unit is divided into the following topics: Prenatal Development Infancy and Childhood Adolescence Learning Outcomes By the end of this unit, student’s will be able to: Define the key terminology related to prenatal and infant physical development, infancy and childhood, and adolescent development. Understand advantages and disadvantages to different research designs in developmental psychology. Understand the cognitive changes that occur during infancy and childhood, and the importance of attachment and the different styles of attachment. Understand the process of identity formation, relationships, and moral emotions during adolescence. Apply your understanding to identify the best ways expectant parents can ensure the health of their developing fetus, how to promote learning, and how to categorize moral reasoning. Analyze the effects of preterm birth, how to effectively discipline children, and adolescent judgment and risk taking.

Designer Babies Explore and reflect upon this contemporary and controversial issue. Designer babies pose many ethical issues and requires careful consideration. Cognitive Change Reflect on your own development before taking a “test” to develop additional insights into your own developmental trajectory. Terminology Practice Take this flip-card activity to self-evaluate how well you know some of the important terms from Chapter 10. Learning Lab Preparation Each topic will provide a question or scenario for you to consider prior to attending your Learning Lab. Be sure to carefully consider each prompt as you will be expected to contribute to the group discussion. Resources Here are some additional resources that will help you complete this unit: Krause, M., Corts, D., Smith, S. C., &amp; Dolderman, D. (2018). Revel for An Introduction to Psychological Science, 2nd Canadian Edition. Pearson Ed. Other resources will be provided online. 0.2 Prenatal Development Physical Development Prenatal development is a time of rapid growth and change. This rapid change continues throughout the first few years of life. Development during early life is clearly a function both of nature and of the environment. Questions to Consider After you have read the first few pages of this chapter you should be able to answer the following questions: How is the gender of an offspring determined? What differentiates zygotes from embryos and embryos from fetuses? (These questions are intended for personal reflection - you are not intended to submit anything for assessment) Designer Babies It is beginning to look inevitable that, however fierce the debate, the technology to make designer babies will happen - maybe just 20 years from now. Geneticists claim to have found the gene for good-parenting, genes for obesity, Alzheimer’s, red hair, and even happiness. Incredibly, scientists have even constructed an artificial human chromosome, which could carry any genes a geneticist - or prospective parents - desired. Embryo A technique called Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) is already being used to screen embryos for genetic diseases. Embryos created outside the body using in vitro fertilization are tested to see whether they carry a genetic disorder before being transferred to the uterus. It’s deeply controversial whether parents should ever be allowed to select embryos just because they’re genetically different. At the moment the technique is used for therapeutic purposes only, to screen for children who may have a deadly genetic disease. Even if some parents and their doctors were willing to use PGD for cosmetic or enhancement purposes, which remains absolutely taboo, the technique is limited in a crucial way - PGD can only select an embryo with genes inherited from the parents. Bottled Genes? One day parents may be able to pick any gene they desire from a range of bottled genes and have it put into their embryos. (quoted from “Designer Babies” website) Learning Activities Designer Babies This activity involves some reading and reflection around the topic of genetic engineering. As this is a contemporary issue, it will be valuable to familiarize yourself with some of the complexities of this technology and think critically about some of the ethical challenges. Your task is to read the following resources and carefully consider the implications of this technology: Editing the DNA of Embryos with CRISPR Designer Babies, CRISPR, &amp; Genetic Engineering Learning Lab Preparation Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following scenario and questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week’s Learning Lab: Modern techniques of conception and human genetic engineer­ing raise important new issues for human development. A pam­phlet containing the following message was left at doorsteps in TWU professor Philipchalk’s neighborhood: Image showing an example of surrogacy message (You may also wish to comment on the “Designer Babies” topic above.) How do you feel about this request? What problems might you anticipate? 0.3 Infancy and Childhood A Child’s View of God One evening on a camping trip several years ago, my wife and I listened outside the tent as our five-year-old Joelle and three-year-old Matthew tried to get to sleep. Always the “mother,” Joelle attempted to dispel her little brother’s fear of bears and other wild creatures by reminding him that Jesus was watching over them. Not content with generalities, Matt responded, “Does Jesus got a gun?” (Psychology and Christianity by Ronald Philipchalk, p. 141) As any Sunday School teacher knows, children see God differently from adults—often in very concrete terms (protection requires a gun!). Studying cognitive development can help us to understand as well as teach children at their own level. The Process of Cognitive Change Our textbook provides a good summary of the structure (stages) of cognitive development. The section, however, does not address the process by which a person moves from one stage to the next. Piaget believed that the key to cognitive development is something called cognitive conflict or cognitive disequilibrium. For cognitive development to proceed, the individual must constantly re-evaluate his or her schemas. According to Piaget, we develop schemas from an early age of life. Schemas are our cognitive representations of the world. Schemas help us to organize our experiences. They also allow us to make predictions about what outcomes might result from particular behaviours. Schemas are very important in helping us to understand and to adapt to the world. Although schemas are important in helping us to understand the world, they are not always accurate. People at all ages can have mental representations of the world that are not correct. Can you think of any examples of inaccurate schemas? Although people at all ages can have inaccurate mental representations of the world, children are especially prone to view the world in an incorrect way. The reason children may view the world in an incorrect way is because the structure of their cognitive processing is developing. Piaget believed that inaccurate schemas are changed only when they are challenged in the cognitive structure of the child. This challenge has been termed cognitive conflict. Basically, the process of cognitive change works as follows: People are motivated to maintain a state of cognitive equilibrium. When a child encounters information from the world and the information is inconsistent with his or her schema, the new piece of information creates a state of disequilibrium or cognitive conflict. Equilibrium may be restored through one of the two processes of adapation called assimilation and accommodation. Assimilation occurs when a child re-organizes the new information in such a way as to make the new piece of information consistent with his or her preexisting schema of the world. Accommodation occurs when a child alters his or her schema such that the new piece of information can now be incorporated into the new schema. Thus the process of accommodation produces the greatest cognitive change. Can you think of examples of both assimilation and accommodation? Here is an example: Equilibrium-Preexisting Schema: Child has grown up in an environment where all people he interacted with were of the same race (mom, dad, siblings, grandma, grandpa, etc.) Child has seen people of other racial groups, but has never interacted with them. Child develops the schema that people tend to like others who are of the same race as him or her. Cognitive Conflict Produced: At four years of age the child begins to attend preschool. At this time he starts to interact with children of various races. The child begins to develop a friendship with a child of a different race. This friendship creates cognitive conflict for the child: “How can I like someone who is a different color?” To resolve this cognitive conflict, the child has two options: Option A- Assimilation: In order to maintain his or her preexisting schema, the child re-organizes the information such that the other child is not perceived to be so dissimilar after all: “Maybe he is a different color from me, but we both speak English. We must not be so dissimilar after all.” Option B- Accommodation: The child’s preexisting schema is altered such that the new information can be incorporated into a new way of perceiving the world, “Maybe I can be friends with someone who is different from me.” Cognitive Equilibrium is Restored Although cognitive equilibrium is restored via either assimilation or accommodation, assimilation serves to maintain an inaccurate schema (that differences inhibit the development of friendships) whereas accommodation serves to produce cognitive change and hence produces a more accurate representation of the world (that differences do not inhibit the development of friendships). Learning Activities Cognitive Change The first three links below are articles that are intended to give you an opportunity to reflect upon your own considerations around development. The last link is a test - along with the first three links, it is intended to provide some insights about your developmental trajectory in light of your crisis resolution, attachment style, and parenting styles: Erik Erikson’s Stages of Social-Emotional Development The Link Between Substance Abuse and Attachment Disorder Stepfamilies: How to Help Your Child Adjust What is Your Parenting Style Learning Lab Preparation Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week’s Learning Lab: What is God like for children of different levels of cognitive development? If you can, give some examples from children you know…. Would children even have an idea of God if they were not taught it? 0.4 Adolescence John has just turned 13. Over the past year he has experienced may changes. He has grown over six inches and he has developed acne over his face and back. Not only is he changing physically, he is also experiencing a wave of emotional, spiritual, cognitive, and sexual changes. John has become self-focused and very self-critical. In addition, he is beginning to think abstractly and to challenge adults’ “dominion” on knowledge. John is also on a quest to understand “who he is” and “what his place is in the world”. John’s quest for an identity makes him more vulnerable to peer pressure and to the influence of radical groups and cults. During this time that we call adolescence, John will make many decisions that will have a profound effect on the direction his life will take. Does any of the above sound familiar? Before you begin reading the textbook section on adolescence, think back to your own adolescence. As you think about your experience of adolescence, use the following questions to guide your reflection: What physical changes did you experience in adolescence? How did these physical changes make you feel? In what ways did your view of the world change during adolescence? How did your way of treating other people change during adolescence? What was most important to you during adolescence? To what extent is “who you are today” a function of “who you became during adolescence”? No Adolescence? In other times and in other cultures to­day, adolescence does not exist as a significant and distinct period of develop­ment. This might seem surprising and difficult to imagine. Think of how modern society would be different, or if it could even exist, without a period of adolescence. What are the advantages and disadvantages of having an adolescent period? Identity The concept of identity is a rich topic for consideration. The most familiar aspect of identity is occupational identity, since much of “who we are” in our society rests on the kind of work we do. Perhaps you can readily relate to this in your choice of major. Less familiar, but equally important, is ideological identity. Ideologi­cal identity, including both religious and political orientations, may un­dergo a tremen­dous upheaval during your student years. Do you have the same political beliefs as your parents? What about religious beliefs? Conflict and questioning of parental beliefs and values may be a necessary part of establishing your personal iden­tity—even if the beliefs and values you ultimately adopt are the same as those of your parents. Learning Activities Read and Reflect In this section we explore adolescence and the changes in development we go through. Below are some resources that help to help support your understanding: Journal of Adolescence Erik Erikson’s Stages of Social-Emotional Development 4 Tips for Parenting Teenagers Terminology Practice In order to review some of the major terms from Chapter 10 in your textbook, practice using the activity below. Although you will not be evaluated on these terms, they will assist you in the assessments for this course: Learning Lab Preparation Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week’s Learning Lab: Would you want to live your adolescence over again if you could? Why or why not? Assessment While there is no “formal” assignment that you will be responsible for submitting for Unit 3, you will be expected to participate in discussion during your Learning Lab. Your facilitator will be providing a participation mark based on your contributions. Below is some information to consider prior to attending your Learning Lab: Active participation in group exercises, reflection, and critical discourse is an essential component of this course. You are expected to show respect for all members of the course, both in your speech and actions. Contribute by actively observing and listening, raising thoughtful questions, examining relevant issues, building on others’ ideas, analyzing and evaluating the group’s thinking, synthesizing key points, and expanding the group’s perspectives. Take care not to dominate a conversation, giving space for others to speak. When in small groups help maintain the focus, flow, and quality of conversations, and take the initiative to invite others (particularly those who are quiet) to speak. Rubric for Participation in Learning Labs Emerging (0-64%) Developing (65-89%) Mastering (90-100%) Never to almost never: Demonstrates active listening (as indicated by disengaged body language and no to rare comments that build on others’ remarks),Initiates any contributions in class or small groups, Makes insightful or constructive comments, Helps maintain a supportive space for others to speak. Sometimes to fairly often: Demonstrates active listening (as indicated by somewhat to often engaged body language and comments that build on others’ remarks), Initiates a contribution at least once in a class or small group discussion; Makes insightful or constructive comments, Helps maintain a supportive space for others to speak. Very often to nearly always: Demonstrates active listening (as indicated by fully engaged body language and comments that build on others’ remarks), Initiates more than one contribution in a class or small group discussion, Makes insightful or constructive comments, Creates a space for others to speak and takes initiative to include others.

Other resources will be provided online. 1.1 Adulthood Psychosocial Development There are many changes we experience during the time we call adulthood. According to Erikson’s theory of psychosocial development, adults move through three important stages during which they must resolve important psychosocial conflicts: Early Adulthood Middle Adulthood Late Adulthood In Early Adulthood (20-40 years of age) the psychosocial crisis is one of intimacy versus isolation. Although it is often perceived as critical whether or not the person develops an intimate relationship with a lifelong partner, Erikson believed that although this is one component of intimacy in this stage, other types of intimacy are also important—like developing intimate relationships with workmates, colleagues, and even one’s children. If one fails to develop a sense of intimacy during this stage, he or she will feel isolation. In Middle Adulthood (40-65 years of age) the psychosocial crises is one of generativity versus stagnation. What is generativity? Erikson used the term gererativity to describe the process by which a person feels like he or she is making a lasting contribution in the world. Usually, generativity involves giving something back to the next generation. People at this stage can feel generative in many ways—coaching a softball team, being a scout leader, teaching children in Sunday School, been a big brother/sister, etc. If a person fails to develop a sense of generativity during this stage, he or she will feel a sense of stagnation. In Late Adulthood (65+ years of age) the psychosocial crisis is one of ego integrity versus despair. If the individual looks back on his or her life and feels a sense of pride in the accomplishments he or she has made, then the individual will feel a sense of ego integrity. However, if the person looks back on his or her life and does not see the significance of his or her accomplishments, then he or she will feel a sense of despair at the meaninglessness of his or her life. Guilt One of the most significant developments in childhood, from both a secular and Christian point of view, is a conscience with its attendant guilt. Is guilt simply a conditioned emotional response (as the behaviorist might say)? Is it the result of conflict with the superego (as a psychoanalyst would say)? Is it the failure to live up to our self-concept (as the humanist might say)? Is it the voice of the Holy Spirit? Or is it some combination of these? (For help on this issue and an important distinction between false and true guilt see Counts and Narramore (1970), Narramore (1984), Tournier (1962).) (from Psychology and Christianity, by Ronald Philipchalk, p. 146) The textbook discusses moral development in childhood and adolescence. However, many adults are troubled by questions of right and wrong, and in particular, by feelings of guilt. The Christian authors noted above suggest that many guilt feelings are not true guilt but false guilt carried over from childhood experiences. Understanding how conscience and guilt feelings develop can help to liberate us from unnecessary false guilt inappropriately attributed to God. Learning Activities Read and Reflect This activity involves some reading and reflection around Erikson’s Eight Psychosocial Stages and an article from Harvard University illuminating the importance of relationships in healthy aging. Erik Erikson’s Stages of Social-Emotional Development Good Genes are Nice, but Joy is Better Learning Lab Preparation Prior to your Learning Lab, take some time to think about the following questions. You will be asked to share your thoughts in this week’s Learning Lab: What do you hope to accomplish during your “adult development” years? (If you are past these years, what are you most pleased with?) 1.2 Death and Dying Death Secular psychologists see death as final. Christians, however, see resurrection beyond, with death being but another step in that direction. What implications do these beliefs have for the process of dying? As medical technology has advanced death has become more and more difficult to define. We need to focus our attention less on preserving the physical and more on preserving the personhood of the individual. This means giving greater attention to our concept of the dying person created in the image of God (as the abortion issue has forced us to do at the other end of life). When is personhood sacrificed to technical efficiency? Should we advocate a more “natural death?” What is “natural death?” How far does one go in “allowing” natural death? (from Psychology and Christianity, by Ronald Philipchalk, p. 146) Hospice You matter because of who you are. You matter to the last moment of your life, and we will do all we can not only to help you die peacefully, but also to live until you die.” (Dame Cicely Saunders) During the Crusades of the Middle Ages a hospice provided lodging for travelers: a place of refuge and comfort. So in 1967, when Dame Cicley Saunders opened a facility in London to provide care and comfort to dying people and their families, St. Christopher’s hospice was an appropriate name.

Cultural Variations The following issues are often subject to cul­tural variations: Adolescence is unknown in some cultures Adolescent struggles and conflict are much less in some cultures (e.g., ) Stage theories may not apply in other cultures Ageism, especially with regard to intellectual abilities, is reduced, unknown, or even reversed in some cultures where the wisdom of old age is venerated The “social clock” may be set differently in other cultures Attitudes toward death vary greatly between cultures 1.3 Assessment In addition to your participation in this unit’s Learning Lab, you will also be responsible for two formal assessments. The first, is your Writing Assignment #1 - more information can be found on this assignment by scrolling down the page. The second assessment that will take place is Quiz #1 - more information can be found by scrolling down the page. Active participation in group exercises, reflection, and critical discourse is an essential component of this course. You are expected to show respect for all members of the course, both in your speech and actions. Contribute by actively observing and listening, raising thoughtful questions, examining relevant issues, building on others’ ideas, analyzing and evaluating the group’s thinking, synthesizing key points, and expanding the group’s perspectives. Take care not to dominate a conversation, giving space for others to speak. When in small groups help maintain the focus, flow, and quality of conversations, and take the initiative to invite others (particularly those who are quiet) to speak. Rubric for Participation in Learning Labs Emerging (0-64%) Developing (65-89%) Mastering (90-100%) Never to almost never: Sometimes to fairly often: Very often to nearly always: 1.4 Writing Assignment #1 Your first assignment for the course will involve reading a formal research article and extracting important information. Research articles play an important role in psychology as they present new findings and research that help us better understand the subject field. It is, however, important for us to understand what information is important as we weigh the value of the article we are reading. This assignment attempts to help us better understand those considerations. Your first task is to read How to Read Empirical Articles As you can see, it is important to understand why you are reading an article and it is important to understand what you want to get out of it. Next, your task is to read How to Read a Journal Article in Social Psychology This article should help support your understanding of formal research articles and how to read them to support your research and learning. Writing Assignment Finally, it is time to apply what we have learned. Download the following article: No More FOMO Writing Assignment After reading the article above, use the content to respond to the following questions: Does this study reflect basic or applied research? How do you know? What level(s) of analysis (biological, psychological, environmental) are being employed in this study? Explain and identify the specific details of the study that show this. What were the findings of previous research that led the researchers to do this study? What was the research question that they attempted to answer? What was (were) the researchers’ hypothesis(es)? How was this study conducted? Was it an experiment or a non-experiment? How can you tell? What were the variables under investigation in this study? Identify the dependent and independent variables, if applicable. What were the main findings of this study? How do they relate to the original study hypothesis(es)? How do the researchers explain their results? What are some other possible explanations? What are some strengths of this study? Limitations? What are the possible implications of these results in the real world? Rubric for Writing Assignment #1 In addition to the criteria included in the rubric below, it is expected that students submit their assignments with an APA style title page. Estimate that each response will be between one paragraph to ½ a page (depending on what the question is asking and how much information is in the article). The total amount of content will be between 2 ½ to 3 pages (not including the title page). Exceeds Expectations | Meets Expectations | Minimally Meets Expectations | Does Not Meet Expectations | ||–|–|-| | Responses are accurate and address the questions in a comprehensive manner | Responses are accurate and address the questions but could demonstrate more meaningful comprehension of content | Responses may lack accuracy in addressing the questions and/or may demonstrate limited comprehension of content | Responses do not accurately address the questions or do not demonstrate any comprehension of content | | Clear, precise and well-reasoned responses | Mostly clear, precise and well-reasoned responses | Some clear, precise and well-reasoned responses | Responses lack clarity, logic and/or precision | | | Spelling and grammar are accurate. | Minor and/or few spelling or grammatical errors. | Several spelling or grammatical errors. | To submit your completed assignment, scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the “Writing Assignment #1” tab - follow the directions there.
